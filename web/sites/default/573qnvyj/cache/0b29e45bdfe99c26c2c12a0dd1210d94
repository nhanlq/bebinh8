Manufacturers that are member of the European association Plastics Europe have voluntary committed to a limit concentration of 0.001% of epichlorohydrin in the resins [8]. . If relatively volatile polyamine hardeners are still used (e.g. In the construction industry as well as in ship, yacht, windmill blade and car manufacturing, large quantities of epoxy products may be applied to large surfaces. Resin drips will also not come out of clothing. Resins with only one unit are liquid, and these are generally used at ambient temperatures (e.g. In 2009, the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work has identified “the increasing use of epoxy products” as one of the major emerging chemical risks at the workplace [9]. Reliable data on the number of workers at risk at a European level, or the number of occupational diseases arising from exposure to epoxy products are not available. This holds true for the epoxy resin itself as well as the polyamine or anhydride hardeners and the reactive diluents [3] [6]. Bamboo fibers (BFs)-reinforced epoxy resin (EP) composites are prepared by resin transfer molding (RTM). Basketter, D., Dooms-Goossens A., Karlberg A.T., Lepoittevin J.P., ‘The chemistry of contact allergy: why is a molecule allergenic?’, Contact Dermatitis, Vol. This may be used for pouring the product (especially cast floors) as well; Apply floor coatings with long-stemmed rollers or with long-stemmed spreaders. 152, 2005, pp. ; Manual transportation of (open) cans or vessels with epoxy products; Application: direct contact during application by means of spatulas, trowels, glue spreaders etc., as well as spatters during application of coatings by means of rollers. In addition, when relatively volatile polyamine or acid anhydride hardeners are still used, products may be classified with H335 (May cause respiratory irritation) and H334 (May cause allergy or asthma symptoms of breathing difficulties if inhaled). Fewer than 10% of people react when overexposed to epoxy resin or hardener. Frequently, skin contact with the individual components or the ready-for-use mixed product gives rise to allergic contact dermatitis (eczema). Mix with a low rotation speed (< 300 rpm) and cover the vessel while mixing; The transportation of mixed material from the mixing station to the application station can be best performed by means of a small trolley. In addition, constituents of epoxy products may cause airway and eye irritation, and airway allergies or even more serious diseases such as cancers or diseases of the reproductive system. Products based on epoxy resins as a binder have become popular in various settings, among which the construction industry and in windmill blade production, as a result of their excellent technical properties. Nearly all of these problems can be prevented by using appropriate PPE (see above). Environ. The majority of those who do develop a health problem can continue using epoxy with adequate precautions. hazardous properties, the main risk being via skin contact. Council Directive 98/24/EG (‘Chemical Agents Directive’) contains minimum requirements concerning the assessment of risks due to exposure to hazardous chemicals at work [12]. Contamination of the surrounding can be prevented by placing the bucket or container on a foil sheet on an even surface. Composite resin dental fillings may be more prone to cracking, breaking, and wearing out than metal fillings, and over time leaks may develop in composite resin fillings. Either epoxy resin or hardener can cause a rash. However, low-quality resins from outside the European Union might contain significantly higher levels. This prevents the risk of erroneous mixing, which increases health hazards (figure 6); Mixing of larger amounts of epoxy product should be done by means of closed, forced action mixing machines (figure 7); Hand mixing should be done with the help of a long-stemmed mixer with a continuously variable mixing speed. If left untreated for long periods it can progress to eczema, a form of dermatitis that can include swelling, blisters, and itching. Practically all major ingredients of epoxy products are moderate to strong irritants as well as moderate to strong occupational allergens. Resins with more than one unit are solid and are either used in a solvent, or at elevated temperatures, e.g. In view of the increasing demand for information to producers, suppliers, converters and users of epoxy resin systems this document is intended to support all involved parties of the value chain to disseminate appropriate safety information for this group of chemicals. Plastics Europe, ‘Epoxy resins and curing agents, Toxicology, health, safety and environmental aspects’, 2006. Measures to prevent negative consequences such as allergic contact dermatitis and airway disease should be implemented according to the  ‘prevention hierarchy’. Because these activities occur irregularly and are generally of relatively short duration, these measures may be appropriate in this case. Available at: [29]. Available at: [20]. These materials, along with a catalyst or curing agent and some type of fiber reinforcement (typically glass fibers) are used in the production of a wide spectrum of industrial components and consumer goods: boats, piping, auto bodies, and a variety of other parts and components. Allergic dermatitis is when the body overreacts to an allergen. In order to enable proper risk assessment and control, companies and workers will have to recognize the products they work with as being epoxy products. The time it takes for a hardener to cause a chemical burn depends on the area of contact and hardener concentration. Frequently, skin contact with the individual components or the ready-for-use mixed product gives rise to allergic contact dermatitis (eczema). Whenever a two- of three-component product is used, one should be aware that it might be an epoxy product. . If you want to eliminate this tiny chance of danger, look for “BPA-free” labels and numbers found at the … Retrieved 4 March 2013, from: HSE – Health and Safety Executive, ‘Controlling skin diseases when handling epoxy resins’, , Bootle, in collaboration with Aalborg BST center, Arbouw, Berufsgenossenschaft der Bauwirtschaft and IVAM UvA (Epoxycode consortium), 2004 (in German). The influence of BFs surface modification (NaOH solution or coupling agents, i.e., KH550 and KH560) on interfacial properties of BFs/EP composites is systematically investigated. As a ‘rule-of-thump’, substances that have a boiling point lower than 250°C are relatively volatile. Your immune system and the degree and frequency of exposure to epoxy affects your chance of becoming sensitized. in construction; figure 4). It’s always more prudent to handle resin with gloves, goggles, and protective clothing in order to prevent risks of contact and splashing. The resin itself doesn’t present quite the same health & safety issues as polyester and is considered little more than a possible irritant to eyes and skin. The contact dermatitis generally expresses at the hands or fore-arms, and sometimes in the face. Most epoxy products – except metal coatings – are solvent free products nowadays (see 'Major applications' as well). Bottom line, do not throw away epoxy in your trash or pour it down a drain. Products based on epoxy resins include: In addition, the components of epoxy products are frequently mixed and applied on-site. Description of Works: The work, which we are to undertake, involves the renewal and upgrade of the existing lift car flooring. In some companies, having a low standard of prevention, this number would be even higher [3]. As it solidifies, epoxy and its components are less likely to enter the body. Inhaling concentrated epoxy vapors, if done frequently or for long periods, can irritate your respiratory tract. Epoxy paint is typically used to cover concrete floors because of its ability to keep the concrete from becoming damaged due to water absorption over time 2. You need to estimate how much mixed epoxy you will use in a certain amount of time. 65-73. 50, No. We have a long history of working with and around epoxies daily. 6, 2006, pp. Useful good practices have also been described in the publication “Managing skin exposure risks at work” by the UK Health/ and Safety Executive, and an EU-OSHA publication with the same theme (see Further reading). This provides epoxy products their favourable properties, such as [2] [3]: Figure 2: Building blocks of epoxy products: Bisphenol-A (a), Epichlorohydrin (b), example of a polyamine hardener: diethylene triamine (c). N.Y. Acd. The risk of exposure to epoxy resin, hardener, and mixed epoxy is greatest when they are liquid. epoxy resin These four substances were previously evaluated under the Second Phase of Polymer Rapid Screening, which identified CAS RN 25036-25-3 (one of the DGEBA epoxy resins) and CAS RN 28064-14-4 (Novolac epoxy resin) as having low potential to cause ecological harm, however further evaluation of human health risks was warranted. 1. Reporting schemes of incidents and health problems within the company – in addition to any reporting obligation to national occupational disease registries – may increase the companies’ capacity to trace any remaining risks not tackled yet. The finished, hardened epoxy resin does not pose any health risk and … Smokers and others whose lungs are under strain are far more likely to develop serious respiratory problems. Hardener burns are uncommon. Dermatitis - the most common form of dermatitis that can form when epoxy resin (or epoxy resin dust) comes into contact with skin is contact dermatitis or ski… You are most susceptible if you have been grossly overexposed to epoxy or if you are inherently sensitized or allergic to a component of epoxy. Available at: Kalberlah, F., ‘Vergleichende Bewertung von Epoxidharzen – Teil A: Entwicklung eines Rankingsystems für Epoxidharze’, Forschungsvorhaben F 2062, FoBig GmbH, Freiburg, 2006. Nearly all of us can prevent these problems. Epoxy resins are a class of synthetic resins (polymers) that are chemically characterized by the very reactive ‘epoxide group’ (figure 1). 64, 2007, pp. Epoxy resin formulations are important in the electronics industry, and are employed in motors, generators, transformers, switchgear, ... Health risks. The following paragraphs follow this hierarchy of measures. The hardener reacts with the ‘free’ epoxyde groups, into a tough, three-dimensional network: the final, cured polymer. Resin safety applies to resins besides epoxy, including polyester and polyurethane. 76, 2003 pp. Epoxy resins are used in a large variety of applications. Occup. The finished product is a smooth, glossy and durable surface that is easy to clean. As epoxy cures, the chemical ingredients react to form a non-hazardous solid. However, if you are already sensitized to epoxy, exposure to low concentrations of epoxy vapors can trigger an allergic reaction. You are also more susceptible if you have fair skin, if you’ve already been exposed to other sensitizing substances, or if you have hay fever, other allergies or are under stress. Diepgen, T.L., ‘Occupational skin-disease data in Europe’, Int. If you have questions about the safe use of epoxy that’s not covered on our website, please contact our Health & Safety Department. The reactive material can cause severe respiratory irritation and/or respiratory allergies. While spraying, or when splashes may occur, use. 14-21. It is … If left in contact with the skin, they can severely irritate it and cause moderate chemical burns. It is best to avoid all exposure because you cannot know ahead of time how much you can tolerate before you become allergic. By themselves, WEST SYSTEM epoxy hardeners are moderately corrosive. At warmer temperatures and in unventilated spaces, the epoxy vapor levels increase. Ingredients that are less volatile or less capable of penetrating the skin may reduce the risk of harmful effects. Available at: Geier, J., Krautheim, A., Uter, W., Lessmann H., Schnuch A., ‘Occupational contact allergy in the building trade in Germany: influence of preventive measures and changing exposure’, Int. See a physician if irritation persists or worsens after avoiding epoxy for several days. requiring special precautions for human health and the environment. Situations in which solvent-based epoxy products are still used; The use of epoxy products that (still) contain hardeners or reactive diluents that are relatively volatile. & Spee, T., Management of allergic skin disease by epoxy’s in the construction industry; development of an international ‘Code of Practice’, Proceedings of a presentation at the 6th IOHA Conference, Pilanesberg, South-Africa, September 19-23, 2005. However, they are safe to handle, provided that basic precautions are taken. H314 Causes severe skin burns and eye damage. Linear extrapolation of these figures to the European Union leads to an estimated number of cases of about 1,500 each year. Available at: [21]. Polyester resin can aggravate the skin, resulting in skin rashes and redness 2. Breathing highly concentrated epoxy vapor can irritate the respiratory system and cause sensitization. You may become sensitized to epoxy after many exposures or just one. Chemicals in some epoxy resin systems have additional health effects. When epoxy products cannot be substituted, it may be possible to apply an epoxy product that is relatively less harmful.  HSE– Health and Safety Executive, Skin at work (2013), Skin at work. Weighing and mixing the two components: splashes and spillages, contaminated packaging, mixing at a too high rotation speed, in too small vessels etc. Available at: Directive 98/24/EC of 7 April 1998 on the protection of the health and safety of workers from the risks related to chemical agents at work. This article focuses on the use phase of epoxy products, and describes the various types of epoxy products, areas of application, health hazards, professions at risk, developments in the composition and risks of products, the development of classification systems to assess these risks, and control measures, following the  hierarchy of controls. In on-going research it is attempted to include the relative sensitization potential of the products into these criteria in the near future [15]. Workers that have acquired an epoxy-allergy will be faced with an ever stronger skin reaction after each contact with the products. Available at: EU-OSHA – European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, ‘Expert forecast on emerging chemical risks related to occupational safety and health’, 2009. Discomfort may be severe, but the symptoms usually go away after stopping contact with epoxy. Health Risks When polyurethane resin dries, it often requires sanding, which produces a fine dust. Furthermore, several ‘subtypes’ of epoxy products may be distinguished: In this case, higher molecular weight epoxy resins, made up of 2 or 3 units, are used. These methods allow working ‘standing-up’; A splash protection shield (splash guard) attached to the roller prevents spattering; When epoxy resins are injected, such as in concrete repair, use two-component injection pumps (closed, automated mixing), take care when positioning filler necks so that they will not weep during application, provide ventilation openings, ensure packers are free of dust, debris, etc., and use couplings that cannot be pulled out; Use disposable tools (rollers etc.) where I have seen gross mishandling)) caused by improper use or handling, plasticizers and other chemical adjuncts can get atomized or aerosolized from spraying, machining, polishing, or similar applications without proper ventilation or isolation protocols. 541-544. At construction sites and in the manufacturing of wings for wind turbines or cabins of large aircraft the use of epoxy products is most widespread. Available at: Institut für Arbeitsschutz der Deutschen Gesetzlichen Unfallversicherung (2013), Gestis Substance Database, English version, retrieved June 14, 2013 from: JRC (2013), Epoxy resin. Allergic reactions to epoxy can result in irritated skin or respiratory problems. When resin and hardener are mixed, the hardener is diluted and, therefore, less corrosive. Wear a respirator. Available at: [23]. Kersting, K., Geier, J., Rühl., R., ‘Epoxidharze – eine Lösung wird gesucht’, Sicher ist sicher 2008, No. Although mixed epoxy is less corrosive, never leave it on your skin. Epoxy Resins and Carbon Nanotubes Helping Business with Risk, Regulation and Responsibility Background SAFENANO has contributed to a lifecycle analysis study of CNT-containing epoxy resins, to identify critical stages where there may be potential for the release of … Skin contact is the most common means of exposure to resins and hardeners. This reduces the need for cleaning. Health, Vol. Concrete repair agents and wood repair agents. RoutesofExposure Skincontactisthemainrouteofexposure,through splashesontotheskin,immersionofhands/armsinthe substanceorcontactwithcontaminatedsurfaces. There are numerous types of art mediums that artists should consider personal protection for, … You should also take off any clothing that has come into contact with the chemical. Most curing agents in use today have a certain toxicity. floor layers) develops an epoxy-allergy at a certain moment in their career [3]. By Mike Barnard When mixing larger batches of resin and hardener, pot life— or the amount of time that elapses before the epoxy hardens in the container—is very important. where possible. Partially cured epoxy sanding dust, if allowed to settle on the skin, can also lead to contact dermatitis. Available at: [31]. Using epoxy resin is a creative way to make art, jewelry, and crafts. Occup. Through our own experience and the experience of other builders, we can estimate the likelihood of health effects from handling WEST SYSTEM resins and hardeners. Never breathe the sanding dust of partially cured epoxy. Consult the Safety Data Sheet; The use of epoxy products in confined spaces; Preferably, choose ‘epoxy kits’ with a well-defined mixing ratio for the components, that are fully consumed during one application (‘one unit’ packaging). 84, No. Arch. At room temperature, epoxy vapors are unlikely to be highly concentrated. Safety goggles. Industrial products that contain epoxy resins – such as car parts – may be produced in closed systems that largely prevent exposure to the non-cured product. Technical data sheets and the  safety data sheets should be consulted as well. Finished, hardened epoxy products are practically non-toxic unless they … Irritated skin is by far the more common of these two health effects. The employer should provide for a separated mixing area which is clearly marked, so that co-workers not involved in the work involving epoxies can be protected from exposure. Sensitization is the condition of being allergic to a substance. Fully cured epoxy poses few health... Mitigating the Risks of Epoxy Floors. Generally, the  product labelling may warn the worker as well (figure 5). Table 2 provides a number of recommendations [6]. In addition, epichlorohydrin is classified as carcinogenic in the category 1B, ‘presumed human carcinogen’, according to the EU classification [7] However, breathing any nuisance dust will worsen existing respiratory problems. 429-438. Epoxy resins are typically mixed with a hardener component before application. Available at: Coenraads P.J., ‘Construction and validation of a photographic guide for assessing severity of chronic hand dermatitis’, British Journal of Dermatology, Vol. Read the product’s material safety data sheets (MSDS) so you can identify symptoms and employ preventive and first aid measures. The Designate items as resin only. Available at: [16]. WEST SYSTEM fillers present few hazards by themselves. Resume epoxy use only after symptoms disappear, and strictly follow the recommended handling procedures to prevent exposure. Irritant contact dermatitis may enhance the penetration of allergens through the skin, increasing the chance of developing an allergic contact dermatitis. The same goes for mixing containers and utensils. After application, a chemical reaction takes place producing an inert final material. It is difficult, but not impossible to prevent recurrences. In the period 1999-2011, 2,950 cases were registered, i.e. Variables that affect this calculation include temperature, volume, surface […] Despite controversial media coverage, the US Food and Drug Administration (), Health Canada, European Food Safety Authority (), and other organizations have found no risks for consumer health at typical exposure levels.The research is still ongoing, though. But it takes quite a large volume of harm occurring due precisely toxicity. Ausschüss für Gefahrstoffe, 2006, TRGS 401 – Risks resulting from skin contact – determination, evaluation, measures, Ausschüss für Gefahrstoffe, Baden Württemberg, 2006 (in German).

However, users should be aware that epoxy products will always remain strong sensitizers, even if they possess a ‘reduced hazard’. Available at: [27]. Risk Assessment Method Statement Renewal of lift car flooring. The most common reaction is contact dermatitis or skin inflammation. Epoxy products are potent skin sensitizers (allergens). Usually, it appears much like a reaction to poison ivy and may include swelling, itching and red eyes. The range of uses of epoxy resin systems includes adhesives, paints and coatings, sealants, inks, fillers, reinforced polymer composites and varnishes. Epoxy resin is toxic to marine life and ecosystems, so if it is disposed of in sewers, drains, or your household rubbish, these habitats and creatures can die off. In the Dutch construction industry it has been estimated that one out of every five workers that frequently use epoxies (e.g. In practice, workers appear to find it hard to fully avoid skin contact with epoxies during work. This page was last edited on 17 October 2013, at 08:23. EU-OSHA – European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, ‘Occupational skin diseases and dermal exposures in the European Union (EU-25): policies and practice overview’, 2008. 946-954., Available at: [19]. In this case, so-called ‘reactive diluents’ are added - generally glycidylethers - which react with the hardener and become part of the cured resin. When the origin of the problem is found, adequate prevention measures should be implemented and their effectiveness should be evaluated. Arch. Tavakoli, S.M., ‘An assessment of skin sensitization by the use of epoxy resin in the construction industry’, Research report 079, Health and Safety Executive/ TWI Ltd, Bootle, 2003. HSE – Health and Safety Executive, ‘Managing skin exposure risks at work’, Health and Safety Executive, Bootle, 2009. Measures at source: substitution by less harmful epoxies, Early detection and monitoring of work-related diseases. Once sensitized, additional (and sometimes increasingly severe) reactions become likely upon future exposures, even to tiny amounts of epoxy. Spee, T., van Duivenbooden, C., Terwoert, J., ‘Epoxy resins in the construction industry’, Ann. Bourke, J., Coulson I., English J., ‘Guidelines for the management of contact dermatitis: an update’, British Journal of Dermatology, Vol. Good practices to prevent skin disease when handling epoxy products in the construction industry have been described in references [3] and [6]. Allergic dermatitis one of the more serious health effects, but less than 2% of epoxy users are likely to get it.
