Since 65 is the magic sum for this matrix … In Matlab compute using [L,U]=lu(S). where L is a lower triangular matrix and U is an upper triangular matrix. But it will do so by swapping rows. Although there are many different schemes to factor matrices, LU decomposition is one of the more commonly-used algorithms. LU decomposition can be viewed as the matrix form of Gaussian elimination. Do not use a pivoting strategy, and check your results by verifying that [ A] [ A] − 1 = [ I]. LU method can be viewed as matrix form of Gaussian elimination to solve system of linear equation. Instead of taking a square matrix all the way to RREF, it is simpler, and often just as useful, to take it to upper decomposition creates reusable matrix decompositions (LU, LDL, Cholesky, QR, and more) that enable you to solve linear systems (Ax = b or xA = b) more efficiently.For example, after computing dA = decomposition(A) the call dA\b returns the same vector as A\b, but is typically much faster.decomposition objects are well-suited to solving problems that require repeated … Other MathWorks country sites are not optimized for visits from your location.
