</html>";s:4:"text";s:13804:"I want to say thank you for the detailed guide(s)! I don’t even have all of the suggested items yet and it tears through most everything. Thanks! Even with my experience in the game, it happens often to me as well . I understand everything, and everything goes great for me, only one thing confuses me. The main differences being I started with Occultist and maxed bloody pox / wasting and I went with Bat, Falcon, and Huntress devotions before following your build from about 40-80 though I haven’t respeced yet to copy it fully. BP is one of my favorite skills in the game . Mobs rarely even reach you as they die of gushing wounds running through your AoE damage.It’s important to mention that the damage from Grasping Vines stacks, so be sure to keep those 3 stacks up on tough targets whenever you can!Survival is all about killing most targets from a distance and if necessary setting up the Vitality Leech paired with the regeneration of Blood of Dreeg (which should always be active) and healing of Wendigo Totem. I am a returning player, but I have very limited time to play, so this guide is godsend for me. hey david first off i would like to say this build brought me back i wrote off grim dawn 3 years ago to play poe but really wanted to give it a shot again and i love DOT builds and i have to say i love this build (currently lv52). Thanks for the feedback! I thought bloody pox was a bit like this due to increase in bleeding resistance in the later game. It was after posting the first version of this build that Valinov came along, sharing his similar build (with a different devotion structure and a few items, but the same sets). First point of BAT gives 15% vit dam, + 15% bleed dam. This means you can craft an entire set just from the helmet recipe! Is it lvl restricted ot something? 2017-2020 Created by Dammitt. Grim Dawn Occultist Build - phirearmor. Posted: (10 days ago) I played Grim Dawn quite a while back but got extremely busy with real life and haven't had time to really get back into it. How inferior do you think this line would be? Get those resistances up and you’ll do just fine . Makes a huge difference. Thank you again for your awesome build and guide! you put just enough mastery points in to reach a skill to put the skill points in). Hey Zack! Am I missing something somewhere? If I recall, Grasping Vines does stack – apologies for not knowing with 100% accuracy off the top of my head as I haven’t played this build in months – but if I were to return and start from scratch, I’d probably choose this build as my first return build since I love DoT builds . I hope this helps! Thx for the help! One thing to keep in mind is compare the end-game setup (especially devotion links) to see if there would even been room to tie a trigger action to rend. One thing, for the last devotion point you take gallows for 15% vit damage. I’ve tried to get into this game multiple times but this is the first time I actually felt “addicted” lol. Can you provide a link to Valinov’s updated guide so I can reference it in this one? Thanks for watching.Do you think I should add something? But if you place multiple GVs, only the DoT of the last one counts. Thanks for the support! Not only is his build rock-solid (I’ve switched over and it’s fantastic), he’s personally cleared SR89 with it, showing great end-game viability. Thanks for that reply. https://steamcommunity.com/app/219990/discussions/0/361787186436190400/. Are you selecting the (Recommended) build? Im two points short, just did a 4 day bender on this game and am now back to work for 3 long days, I will see if I missed completing a constellation, I know I didnt miss a crossroads one, hoping thats it. I use that religiously when fine tuning my resists when i hit elite and ultimate. Thanks for the feedback; I’m glad the build is working! I’ve completed AoM on Elite, currently lvl 86. Welcome! For example, you’ll farm better in Act I Ultimate vs. Act IV Elite. I tried to lookup other “guides” and all of them just slap on a grimtools link, some vid links and call it a day. Not sure what you mean; the Recommended build seems accurate per the devotion guide – you put Curse of Frailty on the next to last node in Dying God and avoid taking the last node. I feel it's game that I am going to spend A LOT of time on. From the title I assume it is just vitality dmg and bleed damage, correct? You most certainly recall correct, I tried to remove points from Second Rite, and the decay damage plummeted. Hi, so far I love your DOT conjurer. (Prior) L100 Wildblood & Valguur End-game Build: Your email address will not be published. Oh! Im following the devotions part of this guide to a T. Im having an issue as once i finish the Wendigo and crossroads Im short the Chaos requirement for Revenant. I hope this helps! Just keep going, and you’ll find better and better gear! left click is Savagery, right-click is Devouring Swarm, #1 is Grasping Vines, etc). Is there an implicit property of this skill that allows it to spread, or am I missing a mechanic somewhere? Rarely will you need to do more than this, but some trash in Ultimate (when you get to AoM or bleed/vitality resistant mobs) can require a 3rd cast of Bloody Pox (which procs Wendigo’s Mark), which spreads beautifully through a large group. 90: Osyr’s Wisdom  | 15% Vitality Res   15% Bleeding Res  | Accessories | Cult of Dreeg Revered You can get all 3, so you can choose any one you want – I choose based on the movement speed (as my first). Any advice on leveling a conjurer? The build can actually be quite tanky with the right gear and leech damage, but some bosses just hit too hard and you’ll have to kite them – but a DoT build is perfectly built for this gameplay style.Rotation for Trash: BoD always up. Hello everyone. I am not sure to understand what you meant. If you are having single-target damage problems (due to self-found items) go ahead and take Phase III before Phase II and start beating on bosses. the second time I start GD because the first time I wasn’t happy with the build. Here’s the kicker. You’re referring to Raise the Dead on Revenant, correct? If I recall, when Bloodydots was released, all the FG core items were out, so I think it’s still BiS gear – however with the latest 1.5 patch I believe some new uniques were added, so there may be some consideration for them – I’d have to review though. It was a typo – should have been Crossroads, not Ascendant. Worked out great and I really enjoyed it. You can also whack them twice and run away. I have forgotten pretty much everything about the game. This build has gotten me easily through just about everybody in Elite so far – except the Guardian of Solael, who typically kills me within a few seconds. So if you can do Act I Ultimate, do the warden run for farming. Luckily, a player put together a guide on Farming Eldrich Essence. Just finished up getting the Revenant Devotion, and I was curious as to it’s purpose? Quite sure it’ll tone down at >90 but at least so far it’s going realy well. lol). Hope you’re well man! That should be at least 50% by Elite. Thanks for your quick reply. Thanks very much! Thanks for the support, Gage! This is fantastic because it supports “account building” with extending storage to be anything the player feels is important in the future or for another build.Item Color Filter (https://forums.crateentertainment.com/t/tool-rainbow-filter-item-highlighting/42765) A fantastic visual modifier to the game that shows item prefixes and suffixes in colors based on their damage/resist/skill type. Cycle through the same as cooldowns are made available. I see. . It’s been so long since I played the guide I can’t remember the specifics, but the grimtools link should show you where all of the points go. It’s been awhile since I played this build so I think some of the “buffs” I place on the 2nd page of skills; but the actual combat “play” skills all fit on the 1st page (there’s 10 of them – including LMB and RMB so you only need 8 slots). Loving this build, my first character to go Elite. Grim dawn best pet build. Do you think there is a more efficient way to include Huntress? Unfortunately, I don’t have any video guides at this time. I’m new to the game and this is my first build and so far it’s going really smooth. Glad to hear everything is going well! Conjurer – arguably best class for pet builds, I heard there's about five distinct pet builds all capable of high SR. If I recall, GV is much better while leveling up whereas swarm has a greater impact towards end-game when mobs don’t die in just a second or two as Swarm helps with the spreading disease. Because it increases your OA and DA (think of it as whack a stack of buffs) and does some fair damage – however this is situational. I found out that this item “Bone Talisman” which is a quest reward from “The Lost Elder” in act 2.Really helps with the energy and also a 100% dmg increase. It was after posting the first version of this build that Valinov came along, sharing his similar build (with a different devotion structure and a few items, but the same sets). This build utilizes bonuses from two sets: the first is the Wildblood set (3 items: 2H, Shoulders and Belt). Which should I choose; your typed leveling order or the Grimtools link? So far I’ve had no problems shredding through elite like this but if I hit a wall I know what to change. Thanks for the guide! Savagery / Tenacity of the Boar / Storm Touched ? Crossroads (Eldrich) → Scholar’s Light → Crossroads (Primordial) → Eel → Kraken → Jackal → Wendigo (Bloody Pox) → Crossroads (Chaos) → Revenant (Swarm) → Crossroads (Order) → Panther → Solemn Watcher → Dying God (CoF) [PARTIAL] → Lotus → Hawk → Remove Crossroads (Eldrich, Chaos, Primordial, Order) → Rattosh (Vines) → 1 Point into Bat (15% Vit/Bleed Damage) OR Ultos (OA)As covered above, this build utilizes both the Wildblood and Valguur’s sets with additional legendary items for support. I’ll be sure to try out some of your other builds once I finish the entire game with Bloodydots. You’re welcome, and thanks for the feedback! One thing: “It’s important to mention that the damage from Grasping Vines stacks” – do you really mean GV or did you mix it with Savagery? The Tome is found on Canen’s Corpse. Long live the DOTs! Hi there. Thanks for the clarification! Or even maxing Aspect of Guardian. This build uses multiple Bleed & Vitality damage skills to melt enemies while having great survivability with tanking pets/totems and life leech healing. Is it for the 3% OA increase at the end of Hawk? Is there any reason why you have GV as the last skill that you max? GV on the target, CoF, Swarm, BP, and lay down your Storm Totem, Wendigo Totem and then BEAT THEM MERCILESSLY WITH SAVAGERY! I am still using your general leveling guide, which is so incredible helpful! This will help you get to Revered much quicker, and give you access to the necessary augments to help your resists in Ultimate.Augments ListThe factions a player gets Honored and Revered with first are generally: Devil’s Crossing, Rovers, Homestead, Black Legion, Order/Kymon, and Coven of Ugdenbog. Note you’re not expected to have end-game BiS (Best in Slot) gear anytime soon – one reason I choose the builds I did (this included) because they perform so well even without BiS gear. I checked the skill and its modifiers, but it doesn’t mention being able to affect more than one target per cast. hey thanks for the build it was my first character in GD…I have it pretty much done(except for rings) and have finished all normal and dlc content through ultimate(except super bosses). I didn’t really want affliction but I didn’t have enough points to finish Revenant, nor dying god. Hey, Just want to understand. It also deals with Grim dawn best pet build on internal trauma Crook is a must for the bonus to pets. Everything in this guide is useful, especially the mod-recommendation. Has there beeen a change to devotions since this guide was released? I was very happy to see it works great for Survival and Permadeath as well (just need to get bones or tech to raise the initial $10M). Anyway, quick question. I never would have guessed that that setting would affect it. One of my favorite builds is the Dual Wield Elemental Purifier, and was the first build guide I did. Hey bro, loving the build so far. Absolutely enjoying this build; thanks again for the guide man!! I really like the Rend from Huntress but Falcon as a 5 point constellation probably isn’t worth it. finding components and relics). Remove Crossroads (Eldrich, Chaos, Primordial, Order). As far as Wendigo’s Mark, I honestly don’t know off the top of my head. This is quite different from my previous builds that have focused on a few core skills maxed on, so I just want to make sure I’m getting the most out of it. thanks! Thanks for the support! For tougher trash, just GV and Curse of Frailty (CoF). I am making a pet based build and was wondering if i should max out 1 pet (and some of their skills) first or spread skill points out to unlock all pets and then build them up? The quest unlocks after you’ve progressed to the Oasis area. 70: Necrosis/Solael’s Decimation (Relic), and how they compare to the one you can get as a quest reward in act2, as that one wasn’t listed. First off thank you for all the guides you made, I just started this game and your guides were easy enough to understand for a complete beginner like me. Hey, firt time playing Grim Dawn and i’ve been following your build, lvl 35 atm, and crushing everything.
