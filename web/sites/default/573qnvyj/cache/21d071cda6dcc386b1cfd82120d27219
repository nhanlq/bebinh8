What is Competitive Programming and How to Prepare for It? Solution Review: Problem Challenge 1. Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters in C++; Finding longest substring between two same characters JavaScript; Finding the longest Substring with At Least n Repeating Characters in JavaScript; Program to find length of longest substring which contains k distinct characters in Python Longest substring with atmost K characters from the given set of characters. Input : s = “artyebui”, k = 2 Explanation: The longest substrings with no more than â3â distinct characters are âcbbebâ & âbbebiâ. Finally, the largest length will be the result. Next Longest Substring with At Least K Repeating Characters ... leetcode 340 Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters Analysis & Implementation - Duration: 12:20. You are given a string(str) and a number K. 2. Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters which is literally the same as the one with K = 2. The code can be easily extended to 256 characters. Space complexity: O(k) where k is the size of the sliding window. and its length is 14. Output : 14 For example, Given s =âecebaâand k = 2, T is "ece" which its length is 3. Medium. Subarrays with K Different Integers. Then the test cases follow. Find distinct characters in distinct substrings of a string. In this solution, a hashmap is used to track the unique elements in the map. Please write comments if you find anything incorrect, or you want to share more information about the topic discussed above. Medium. Suppose we have a string; we have to calculate the length of the longest substring T that contains at most k distinct characters. Output : 6 Get hold of all the important DSA concepts with the DSA Self Paced Course at a student-friendly price and become industry ready. A simple way is to generate all the substring and check each one whether it has exactly k unique characters or not. In one operation, you can choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character.. Find the length of the longest sub-string containing all repeating letters you can get after performing the above operations. Ask Question Asked 3 years, 11 months ago. Active 29 days ago. As soon as we get a (k + 1)th character we take note of the length of the current window (which does not include this (k + 1) character), because it may so happen that the current window is the longest substring with at most two distinct characters. Take â¦ Below are the implementations of above. I felt they were bit too complex. How to begin with Competitive Programming? If there are more than one substring of longest possible length, then print any one of them. So, if the input is like s = "eceba", k = 2, then the output will be 3 as T is "ece" which its length is 3. Given a string s we have to find the length of the longest substring of s which contain exactly K distinct vowels. Longest substring having K distinct vowels, Longest Substring having equal count of Vowels and Consonants, Longest substring consisting of vowels using Binary Search, Longest substring of vowels with no two adjacent alphabets same, Find the String having each substring with exactly K distinct characters, Encrypt string with product of number of vowels and consonants in substring of size k, Length of the smallest substring which contains all vowels, Lexicographically smallest K-length substring containing maximum number of vowels, Generate an N-length string having longest palindromic substring of length K, Length of longest substring having all characters as K, Length of longest common subsequence containing vowels, Longest Subsequence of a String containing only vowels, Longest subsequence consisting of alternate vowels and consonants, Count anagrams having first character as a consonant and no pair of consonants or vowels placed adjacently, Find if a given string can be represented from a substring by iterating the substring “n” times, Partition given string in such manner that i'th substring is sum of (i-1)'th and (i-2)'th substring, Length of the largest substring which have character with frequency greater than or equal to half of the substring, Minimum length of substring whose rotation generates a palindromic substring, Minimum removals to make a string concatenation of a substring of 0s followed by a substring of 1s, Check if a string can be split into two substrings such that one substring is a substring of the other, Generate a string of size N whose each substring of size M has exactly K distinct characters, Minimum length substring with exactly K distinct characters, Construct a string of length L such that each substring of length X has exactly Y distinct letters, Data Structures and Algorithms – Self Paced Course, Ad-Free Experience – GeeksforGeeks Premium, We use cookies to ensure you have the best browsing experience on our website. If unique elements exceeds than required in window, start removing the elements from left side. The idea is to find length of the longest common suffix for all substrings of both strings and store these lengths in a table. Thus overall it would go O(n3).
