One Dimensional Motion Using an Incline Plane. When it reaches the end of the incline it falls through a height of 3 meters to reach a waiting cart. Forces on an Incline: What Is the Mathematical Relationship Between the Angle of Incline and the Acceleration of an Object Down the Incline?                  the actual height in data tables A and B. Move the motion sensor or the tube so that the distance between them is at … we want to assure that the initial speed is zero (stationary). In this experiment there are FOUR VARIABLES. The base equation x = x o + v o t + 0.5(at 2 ) will be used to study the position of the cart and will be derived to receive the following velocity equation, v = v o + at. Open Capstone. We analyzed the motion of five objects which included a mass attached at the end of a spring, a swinging pendulum, a ball thrown up in the air, a jumping student, and a cart rolling up and down an incline. Pre Lab (Follow this link to print the Pre lab) One Dimensional Motion Using an Incline Plane (Follow this link to print the Procedure/Data Sheet) The cart with the Picket Fence (PF) is being held against the backstop prior to being released. This component gives the force pressing the block against the surface, and is equal and opposite to the normal force (not shown). COSAM          Motion on an Incline Lab Motion on an Incline Lab This lab involved an object moving up and down a ramp. Then graph time & instantaneous velocity (slope of tangent line) data in a new Logger Pro graph. The height from which the object is released on the ramp. The average acceleration of the cart is equal to the acceleration due to gravity, g, times the sine of the angle of the track. Using this data we can evaluate it's velocity and acceleration at specific points. The intercept gave the initial position of the object. In this environment you will be able to study the forces on a block that is on an inclined plane. Again the cord to the force sensor is being held to minimize its effects on the system. Score: /30.
