", "This piece of cloth was used to wipe Hifumi's glasses clean. ", "The inconsistency Kyoko's talking about is... the lights! ", "Seeing the ball, you thought of a way to take care of everything. ", "Wait! 	 ", "Meanwhile, she wanted us all to think Mukuro was still alive, and hiding somewhere inside the school. ", "That's true, everything you just said, it doesn't explain why the magazine was hidden, does it? In fact, I have proof! ", "The bloodstain by the magazines is proof of that. They switched at the beginning. ", "This explains why there were two wounds on Sakura's head. ", "But one of the victims may have been murdered, and murdered again! ", "Soon after, she watched as Sakura slowly opened her eyes. ", "Evidence that the killer had trouble getting into the bathroom... you're talking about the doorknob, right? ", "It's not a picture of the suspect dragging Hifumi away. ", "In all the photos, there's a certain similarity, an unusual circumstance. ", "It's safe to assume that's because whoever used the sword got some of it on their hands. ", "See, look! ", "They probably stabbed her to draw attention away from what actually killed her! ", "When Celeste told us that, we decided to split up and search the second floor. ", "But Chihiro died from a blow to the head, right? But the killer had the confidence to take a shot. ", "The reason hammer #4 was used, was to create confusion about the order of the crimes. ", "There's really no way she could've picked it up, and come away completely clean. ", "That's right, there wasn't a single hair on the floor! ", "All they had to do was hit that switch, and the incinerator would come to life.

She just saw a chance to help Hifumi sneak out of the nurse's office. ", "Wouldn't it be strange for someone who kills the same way without fail, to suddenly change their method? ", "Sayaka knew about that because I told her. ", "The way he's acting, it makes it seem like he doesn't have anything to do with him. ", "And just like Hiro, she grabbed another Monokuma bottle and attacked her. ", "I guess it's some kind of confidential file the police put together about the Genocide Jack case. Like someone cut into it with something sharp. ", "And that explains how Sakura was attacked twice with the same type of weapon! ", "If you really were the killer, that stuff wouldn't have any effect on you. ", "The broken handbook that was in the main hall...", "What I mean is, I think Mondo swapped out his handbook for one that actually works.

", "And the reason they knew that is because the sauna had already wrecked their own handbook! 		Birth Date ", "That's when you picked up the bottle, right? ", "That was the bottle Hiro hit Sakura with, right? ", "Let me rephrase that, in a way that maybe makes more sense.
