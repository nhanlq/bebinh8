Our silicic acid and humate formulas increase the essential nutrient and mineral levels in the plant, resulting in stronger and healthy growth and increased yields. higher nutritional value & longer shelf-life) crops and higher crop-yields per hectare. Silicic acid, by virtue of being regenerated from silica instead of from relatively labile POM, is regenerated more deeply than the other major nutrients (Figure 1; Dugdale et al., 1995).This decoupling between silicic acid and the other nutrients and the fact that not all phytoplankton utilize Si means that there is no Redfield relationship between Si and C, N, or P. In its crystalline state, it is not dissolved by any oxacids.                   SAAT has been shown to be effective on a number of crops and their growth parameters like for instance an increased root system, promoted growth of stems and til-lers, enlarged leaf areas and leaf chlorophyll content and Mills Vitalize 500ml. 397 0 obj<>stream Siliforce acts as a … Mono-silicic acid is particularly good at increasing the transport of heavy, immobile minerals like calcium. higher nutritional value & longer shelf-life) crops and higher crop-yields per hectare.

He has been involved in medicine research for HIV/AIDS since 1990. Developed in conjunction with Rexil Agro BV, the inventor and leader in Silicic Acid Agro Technology, years of testing in various environments around the world have led to a uniquely bioavailable form of silicon that can be used as a root soak or foliar spray to improve growth and yield, increase nutrient uptake, and improve pathogen and stress resistance. The silicic acid agro technology (SAAT) is the application of stabilized silicic acid on the plant. What does it do? Silicic Acid Agro Technology (SAAT) Based on the application of (stabilized) silicic acid products, utilizing SAAT produces higher quality (e.g. The unique formulations stabilises liquid silicic acid into a nutrient solution which is proven to be fully available to the plant via both foliar and root application. $200.00.
