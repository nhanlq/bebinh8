It's scope is awesome; it is wholesome like, I dunno, an Australian League of the Own (minus baseball and only with one woman protagonist!) I didn't know that much about Australian history and all the difficult tensions and conflicts that existed between the indigenous folks and whites, and perhaps my appreciation of the book suffered as a result. In 1910, the cork-core ball was introduced. Tyler Jackson is a long, long way from home. Thanks. A Long Way From Home chronicles the struggles and triumphs of the African-American and Latino players who followed Jackie Robinson into white professional baseball. Also a window into how indigenous Australians were treated, and therefore relevant here now and everywhere always.  Jackie Robinson broke baseball’s color line in 1947, but it took another generation of Black and Latino players to make the sport truly open to all. It also beautifully paints Melbourne of the era.

CARY, N.C. -- Angel Martinez grew up in the mild tropical marine climate of Vega Alta, Puerto Rico, where the weather changes little from season to … The first part is an exploration of white Australian culture and its enduring motifs including cars, masculinity and yobbo culture. There are some sad and horrific truths about the ingrained racism and maltreatment of the aboriginal population in Australia, which come out and haunt all the characters. Set in the early 1950s in Bacchus Marsh, Victoria, the main characters are Irene and Titch Bobs, a happily married couple who want to be Ford dealers and set up their own car yard but Holden has recently emerged and is challenging Ford for supremacy. Negro League statistics from 1920 to 1948 will now be officially classified as "major league," marking a long-overdue acknowledgment of the accomplishments of players who didn’t have the opportunity to play in the American or National Leagues Dodger Stadium, Los Angeles Music Mickey de Grand IV and Sam Garner.
