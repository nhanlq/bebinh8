They both dedicated themselves to advising royalty and the ruling class in the art of administration as well as in the secrets of success and survival in a world that was at once uncharitable and unprincipled. Perhaps Kauṭilya’s approval of divorce [parasparaṁ dvesānmokṣaḥ] and widow marriage (AS III.iii.16; ii.21) might have made him a heretic in the eyes of the orthodox and powerful brāhmans. Written during the Spring and Autumn period through the Warring States period, the Analects is a collection of Kongzi's teachings and discussions with disciples.  At forty I was without confusion. Also, such abdication could have been perceived in people’s mind as a legitimate vānaprastha in everybody’s life. The Buddhist teachings were apolitical and even anti-political, but they facilitated the development of absolutism by neutralizing the influence of powerful brāhmaṇs who, as the recognized natural leaders of the people, had hitherto opposed monarchical centralization and kept the ambitious kings at bay. Politically speaking, both fifth-century China and fourth-century India resembled pre-Roman Celtic Britannia comprising feuding chiefdoms and not nation states. As he says, “the object slips away from the foolish person who continuously consults the stars; for an object is the (auspicious) constellation for (achieving) an object; what will the stars do?” (AS IX.iv.26).

Despite their preference for a meritorious and conscientious ruler of men, their prescriptions were too abstract and rigorous to be helpful for a politician and a statesman. Book XVII deals with the political issues of Kongzi’s times. . SAGE Publications Inc, unless otherwise noted. Sadly, Kongzi’s laudable and lofty goals for the life of the individuals as well as of the social order remained a distant ideal that has “never been completely realized in Chinese history, nor in the history of the world” (Jingpan, 1990, p. 428). It appears Kongzi’s was an undeservedly humdrum end of a harried life whereas Kauṭilya, who had avenged himself by dethroning his foolish and arrogant Nanda employer and dared to shock and enrage his young Maurya monarch with the tale of the latter’s mysterious birth, chose to quit his administrative position on his own accord and give up his personal properties to die as an ascetic anchorite. 500) in Iran; Elijah, Isaiah (fl. The well-meaning but somewhat idealistic visionary, despite his innate interest in the odyssey of human life on this planet, wandered around his home state of Lu and even travelled out of state in 497, visiting Wei, Zheng, and Cai, in search of a worthy pupil. A different view is presented by Drekmeier (1962, p. 5) that “Kauṭilya may not have been India’s greatest political mind, but he is at least accessible and his peers—if any—are not.” As Heesterman has written, the practical value of the Arthaśāstra for is time, at least, lies in its “diffusion of power and scattering of resources” with a view to achieving “a universalist bureaucratic state . The instrument of effecting and emulating all this is ritual propriety [li] (AC XII: 1). (Pang, 1988, p. 7), As to his teachings for statesmen and other public servants, Kongzi invoked de, considered a quality of the successful ruler, and urged everyone to follow dao. A book by the title had existed since at least the early Han dynasty, and was listed in the 1st-century imperial bibliography Yiwenzhi with 27 scrolls. The arthaśāstras were denounced for their stark materialism causing social and political decay in the troubled period from the second century BCE to the third century CE witnessing invasions by the Parthians, the Śakas, and the Kuṣāṇas. .

Kauṭilya himself suggests that if the minister “has fallen from favour, he should repair to a forest or engage in a long sacrificial session” (AS V.vi.46).5 The Arthaśāstra was composed probably in retirement.6. The teachings of Confucius have had as great an impact on the culture of the Far East as the Bible has had on that of West. He once lamented, “I have yet to see a man who loved virtue as much as sex” (AC IX: 18). The lucky survivor, however, elicited the attention and affection of the Nanda royal family. ).4 Worked out to its logical conclusion, this single assumptionsustains several corollary views, e.g., that the “Shilun” author must have adapted these Kongzi statements from “records” (jilu /0) of Kongzi’s teachings that were created and maintained bygenerations of devoted disciples, or that the author himself must have been one of Kongzi’s fa- Though ruism or ruljia (that is, Kongzism) had to compete with Buddhism and Daoism under several regimes, Kongzi received wide recognition and respect by the rulers of Han dynasty (206 BCE-220 CE). Candragupta founded the Maurya Empire (322-185). He, however, became the chief minister [xiang] of Lu in 496, but quit his service for some unknown reasons and resumed his peregrination (Jingpan, 1990). Books XIV and XVIII are concerned with the themes of reclu-sion. The name in English derived from the word "analect" which means a fragment or extract of literature, or a collection of teachings. As Pinaki Bhattacharya maintains, “the reading of Arthashastra, research influenced by it and its emanation in this century is largely influenced by the desire of Indian strategists to have a grand strategist of their own in the broader market place of ideas” (Bhattacharya, 2014, p. 734). The Book of Documents is a compilation of 58 chapters detailing the events of ancient China. Both Kongzi and Kautilya would have liked their rulers to be well cultivated, disciplined, and conscientious. (AC II: 4).

Analects 5.12 Zigong said, “What I do not wish others to do unto me, I also wish not to do unto others.” The Master said, “Ah, Zigong!

Kauṭilya in fact encourages aggression only against an enemy—active [śatru] as well as passive [ari] (AS XII.i.10-15; VII.ix.45). The once powerful and the most significant unifier of ancient China, the magnificent (Western) Zhou dynasty (1045-771), had been confronting the rise of warlords and barbarian tribes, such as the Quanrong, with the pretense of a wang [sovereign king] since the ruler of a small state called Chu began the practice in 880 (Schwartz, 1985). Responding to Zizhang’s query about ren, he said, “He who can enact five things in the world is ren” and continued: “Reverence, tolerance, trustworthiness, quickness, and generosity. Such nonacademic interests have no doubt contributed immensely to the distortion of the historical Cāṇakya, but we need not devalue the Arthaśāstra on this score. Very tidy.) Book XIX contains the sayings of the disciples after Kongzi’s death (Eno, 2015, pp. Just as The Great Learning emphasized learning, so did the Analects. Kongzi is believed to have selected the 305 poems in this collection from a much wider collection. An 18th-century work Śivatattvaratnākara accorded Kauṭilya “a celebrated place with no less distinguished teachers of Hindu polity than Bṛhaspati and Śukra” (Dikshitar, 1927, p. 180). Kauṭilya offers a powerful defense for the centrality of artha in human life: “Material well-being alone is supreme, for spiritual good and sensual pleasures depend upon material well-being” (AS I.vii.6-7). He would have the ruler use daṇḍa to curb any lawlessness that might threaten the security of the state and thus suggests utmost vigilance and preparedness to use it (AS I.iv.5). The small man does not know the decree of Tian, and so does not hold it in awe, he is disrespectful towards great me, and he disgraces the words of the Sage. Unlike the latter, written as a discourse, the former is what may be called logia, that is, a record of conversations, something like the Indian Śrīśrīrāmakṛṣṇakathāmṛta [The Nectar of the Sayings of the Twice-Blessed Ramakrishna] or the German Tischreden [The Table Talk of Martin Luther). Both seek to enhance the quality of human life in terms of material and moral riches, their only distinction being the Chinese Master’s teachings are primarily philosophical thus bearing the stamp of universality, whereas the Indian ācārya’s [preceptor’s] insights pertain to the interests of his particular state.

The resurgent Kauṭilya’a political and diplomatic insights in the researches of New Delhi’s Institute of Defence Studies and Analyses are regularly published as short articles in the journal Strategic Analysis. According to Frederick Mote, Kongzi introduced three innovations: creation of the private teacher, introduction of a curriculum of education for future public servants, and finally, accepting students of all social backgrounds, thereby replacing privileges with equal opportunities and hereditary aristocracy with competitive meritocracy (Mote, 1989). By the mid-Song, however, the Analects, Mencius, Great Learning, and Doctrine of the Mean began gaining importance and by the early fourteenth century, the Four Book were the texts for the civil examinations. This paper introduces the Analects of Kongzi (better known to English-speakers as 'Confucius') to non-specialist readers, and discusses two major lines of interpretation. Kongzi studied the Six Arts or Liu Yi (archery, calligraphy, computation, music, chariot driving, ritual) at schools for commoners. He aspired for a quiet, stable habitat for humanity, where everyone is aware of his or her station in life and act out their métier. The Sanskrit text is from Part I (1960, 2nd ed. As he confessed, “as far as exemplifying the junzi in my personal conduct, I have not yet grasped it” (AC VII: 33). Book VII provides a description of Kongzi. 250 CE.

The former president of the PRC Hu Jintao (r. 2003-2013) made Kongzi’s concept of a harmonious society a cornerstone of his ruling ideology (Melvin, 2007). Written during the Spring and Autumn period through the Warring States period, the Analects is a collection of Kongzi's teachings and discussions with disciples. 6.Trautman (1971) argues that Kauṭilya could not possibly have written the entire work. Book XVII deals with the political issues of Kongzi’s times. The Analects of Confucius. His admonition in this regard was clear and somber: “If it is not li, don’t look at it; if it is not li, don’t listen to it; if it is not li, don’t say it; if it is not li, don’t do it” (AC XII: 1). A corollary of the above counsel concerning character building is the caution sounded against the dangers of degeneration and delinquency. The first mythological human ruler Vaivasata Manu exercised coercive authority or daṇḍa to preempt anarchy or the so-called “law of the fish” [mātsyanyāya]. The Kauṭilīya Arthaśāstra. Book of Odes During famine, he would like the ruler to distribute seeds and provisions to the people, embark on a policy of reduction or shifting (of the population), “or he should migrate with people to another region and where crops have grown,” or “he should make sowings of grains, vegetables, roots and fruits along with the water-works or hunt deer, beasts, birds, wild animals and fish” (AS IV.iii.17-18). It is also important to note Kauṭilya’s personal attitude to astrology. A Buddhist work, Maṇjuśrīmulakalpa (ca. This century was a turbulent period for northern India. No, not many” (AC IX: 6). In his descriptions of the “secret practices” for “overcoming the enemy,” he writes, a la Bṛhaspati, “whether calamities are absent or too many or normal the rites prescribed in the Atharvaveda as well as those of the expert ascetics must be performed for success” (AS IX.vii.84).

Some of the divination practices are still used today. “The third chapter in the fourteenth book,” Ms. Saunders aptly comments, “is pure, unmixed magic” (Saunders, 1922, p. 78).  . The Spring and Autumn Annals was traditionally understood as being written by Confucius, but modern scholars believe the text was actually written by various chroniclers from the State of Lu. Sharing links are not available for this article. One scholar posits with unabashed nonchalance that the “contemporary relevance” of Kauṭilya “can serve the purpose of asserting the original thinking of the Asian epistemic communities” and she accomplishes her goal by emancipating the Arthaśāstra from its “power-based Realist” prison and situating the freed text on an “eclectic theoretical base” (Shahi, 2014, p. 68). Kongzi and his disciples perpetuated this image of the Confucian as one who simply transmitted the teachings of the sages of the past and did not create any sort of novel or personal teaching. The golden rule of an ideal social transaction is shu [consideration], that is, avoiding treating others in ways that they themselves would not wish to be treated: “Do not do to others what you would not wish done to you” (AC XII: 2; XV:24). The Arthaśāstra means the science (śāstra) of artha (wealth or a populated territory). Book IX has a variant version of Book VII. 9.Interestingly enough, Kauṭilya’s discussion on war and diplomacy mirrors uncannily the insights of Kongzi’s contemporary in the neighboring state of Qi, Sunzi (544-496), who in his Bing-fa [The Art of War] posited that “the military is a way (dao) of deception.” See de Bary & Bloom (1999, pp. The Book of Documents is often considered the first narrative history of ancient China. Even when he is a supporter of magic and mantra in combatting the calamities, his recommendations for at least one of them, famine, are far from impractical or magical. Surely few individuals in history have shaped their country's civilization more profoundly than … Manuscript content on this site is licensed under Creative Commons Licenses. Just as The Great Learning emphasized learning, so did the Analects. Interestingly, the savant of Lu has been resurrected and reinvented by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in the second decade of the 21st century. Guide them with virtue and align them with li and the people will have a sense of shame and fulfill their roles. 1969). Kongzi was born September 28, 551 in a shi family (Loewe & Shaughnessy, 1999), a quasi-military class (somewhat comparable with the samurai of medieval Japan or the kṣatriya of Hindu India), of the district of Zou near present day Qufu, in southeast Shandong, China. 216-219). Similarly, Kongzi would like the ruler to practice self-cultivation, follow ren and de and thus simulate the shen-ren [sage kings] of yore. Kauṭilya in fact considers fatalism [daivapramāṇa] an attitude of the low-born [arājavījī] (AS VI.i.13). For more information view the SAGE Journals Sharing page.

In 2010, a movie on his life was released. Although a superhuman absolute power in the universe, Tian is aligned with moral goodness, dependent on human agents to actualize its will, even though its associations with them are uncertain and unpredictable. A conventional politician, Kauṭilya commanded a limited interest outside the academic arena up to the 1980s, probably partly because, as Dr. Mabbett observes, the Arthaśāstra contains “plenty of superstition . (AC II: 3). The Analects contains 20 books each featuring chapters compiled and composed by the Master’s associates and disciples, who are introduced in Book I. 3.Another tradition has Kauṭilya hailing from Takṣaśilā, the celebrated university town in the northwest on the borders of the vast Nanda Empire. Additionally, Mencius believes that all human beings are inherently good. On another occasion, he prescribes banishment as a penalty for “practisers of black magic and sorcery” (AS IV.iv.15). He explained further to his disciple Zilu: When names are not correct, what is said will not sound reasonable, affairs will not culminate in success; when affairs do not culminate in success, rites and music will not flourish; when li and music do not flourish, punishments will not fit the crimes.
