</html>";s:4:"text";s:8818:"T+2 is not a database limitation, it’s a deliberate decision by clearing houses to provide a window for cancelling a trade in case there are problems - fraud, etc. Matching is done based on price-time priority. The conspiracy crap is doo doo. As I see, many of them are aware of this and doing mainly for fun/revenge/etc and ready to lose the 'investment'. Simply put both the hedge funds and the brokers have a common interest to ripoff the retailer. No. Margin is a red herring. This would not need to be the case with this type of system,  there are a whole host of political reasons why the system is built the way it is, part of it is the desire to control it (and in this case the wrong people where doing things they were not suppose to), I am sure you will call that "conspiracy", but the reality is that the investment system is setup to be slow and opaque not because of the need for backwards compatibility, or security it is that way so the "correct people"  control it plain and simple, Edit: Sorry, I say it way too much, but this merits a repeat of the one-liner: "The reason God was able to finish the earth in only six days is that He didn't have to worry about backward compatibility [or legacy system integration, or satisfying an installed userbase].". The reason people are specifying that RH accounts are margin accounts by default is because it’s relevant to the financial situation. Robinhood told clients in a blog post that it would close out some positions in CTRM automatically if the client was at risk of not having the necessary collateral. Blockchain does not do anything a database cannot. It wasn’t designed to break a consumer-facing investment app that didn’t even exist yet. The best way (perhaps the only way) to migrate is to start launching new IPOs on this new system. Now YouTube polices its content to such an extent, and with such murky and ever-changing policies, that speech which is perfectly legal and protected by federal law is banned without explanation. >Lying (and hiding this type of information behind dodgy reasons is tantamount to lying) is illegal also. > [T]here's no real reason why ALL companies need to have their stocks compatible. Crypto doesn’t have clearinghouses or the same notion of settlement. It seems like around 60 posts being submitted every second. I think a "conspiracy" requires some sort of actual coordination. If, instead of collateral, you got the cash, capital requirements would be reduced as you would get the money from sales immediately, and wouldn't need to keep a pile of money to collateralize buys while waiting on the income from your sales. Of course they can. In this system, everyone is working to protect themselves (thus not conspiracy), which in turn happens to be screwing over retail. There's a Wikipedia page on it (last edit December 2019): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%2B2, See: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/erroneous-trade.asp. People create excuses all the time for everything. Robinhood and Reddit unleashed a historic week for Wall Street, and Apple is getting really serious about app privacy. To be fair, That's nothing. Visa also doesn’t work the way you think it does, much like checks, ACH transfers, and wires also take days to clear. Take my wife out for a nice dinner or something. The matching of orders for a single asset happens on one machine, call it matching engine. If the cycle of old shorts covering and new shorts taking positions continues, combined with the positive feedback loop of retail FOMO, the stock will continue to go up. e.g. I'm sorry, but "we lied to you for your own good" is still lying. They didn't have a liquidity issue after they disallowed the buying of stocks that had the 100% capital requirement from the clearing houses; hence, they no _longer_ had a liquidity issue. That trust gets built up over a long period of time ideally, starting typically from a very modest beginning. I use Gemini, which has been happy to wire me money that shows up the same day in the other bank’s checking account. Were there no adults at the wheel leading up to this? edit: people seem to think I am cheerleading WSB...far from it, someone there will also get slaughtered by being the last fool to walk in on a risky trade. And yes, most marketing spending is pointless, and that’s just another kind of marketing. What Robinhood is doing isn't particularly uncommon in the industry. But I would say - their underlying intentions are absolutely and totally irrelevant to the discussion. There is no temporary lapse in Integrity. Maybe the takeaway is to not use meme brokers to buy meme stocks. > No. The 'losers' are the one's who are buying high and selling low. Now they both know what's expected of them, without there ever being a written record of anything. Since SMS became a thing, I have watched in amazement, how people have been buying cars, houses, other goods, transferring money, with their cell phones. Keep in mind Robinhood could have just restricted said herd. KYC done ahead of time. Everyone seems to be forgetting how fast this all happened. As a skeptic, why should I believe the regulation is effective? What's more amazing is many of their clients will be destroyed in the largest bubble in history, where money was given out to every idiot with a TD Ameritrade account. everyone trades under the assumption that the system is faster than it is. https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l83va0/gme_... That's a dubious way to refer to people. They had to move money around to post the massively increased cost of collateral. And some short-sellers are shorting it believing it is worth almost nothing. Great. Factor in the broader market and it's less. If you do want to take the down-side of Gamestop, it'd be safer to buy a put option to limit your potential loss. Stock trades don't settle until T+2, so any new purchases using those proceeds are done on margin. >Robinhood cannot use customer funds to satisfy their collateral requirement. No prime brokerage would let Melvin end up near insolvency before issuing liquidation margin call and even if there wasn't enough post-liquidation to cover losses, prime brokerages have a collective market cap of more $1 trillion and are easily able to absorb a several billion dollar shortfall. And to what end? In their UI, the quote is the place with the Buy button. But it is not impossible, says Joann Lublin. With them since the beginning and never a problem. And why only for Robinhood, when several firms had the same policy? All under-capitalized as well? Doing so would have likely pissed people of more. /r/wallstreetbets are also trading against each other, without mercy! If the current price is north of $300, and holding costs on a short for a month aren't too bad, there's like $200+ of movement there to capture. Do you have a link to the full interview? I'm not saying there's a conspiracy, exactly... but I am saying when it came down to making hard choices, it doesn't take a full-blown conspiracy for them to make some of the decisions they made that erred on the side of benefiting institutional investors. You don't need to think one way or another. I'm guessing RH was tapped to the limit, and the buy limits were applied to anything with unbalanced orders. At the scale of money involved legacy tech just shouldn't be an acceptable excuse. Whether the buys and sells came from margin or not doesn't matter. Having the stock market emit 325.95 kg CO2 per transaction [1] is one of the few ways I've ever heard to make the stock market significantly worse for society -- irrespective of your current feelings about it. (Today, Robinhood insists it doesnât factor market makersâ payments into where it routes orders.) Imagine if you stopped paying your mortgage, and the bank sells your house, but they only make 5% of what you paid for it because the price of houses in ubercow's neighbourhood happened to plummet recently. It's a pointless application of the technology. A hedge fund covering a short pays exactly the same price in the market as a meme-following Redditor or an intraday trading algorithm. TDA and Schwab both have their own internal clearinghouses so far as I know. My initial investment was pretty low and when it hit high $140s I took my money and ran. https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/erroneous-trade.asp. It's clear their highest priority was to avoid admission that they were running out of money. Interactive Brokers seem cheap and have APIs and apps for everything. Yes, a meta system that would have the best channels available per topic (HN, Money Stuff, The Aviation Herald/PPRUNE, etc.) Hedge funds loosing their shirts to nerds and soccer moms. It's 2021 not 1960, technology should have evolved over the last decades.
