Native American flutes often have a flue of uniform width along their entire length of the flue.

Native American flutes often have a flue of uniform depth along their entire length (ignoring any leading ramp that transitions from the slow air chamber). This G-scale flute by the store uses a fine bamboo that gives the right sound and makes the flute durable for regular use. Real-world Native American flutes compare well with this theoretical model. ([Wolf 2001], page 10). In flutes that have a taper or flare in their sound chamber, the outside diameter might follow that inside diameter, or the outside diameter might be independent of the shape of the sound chamber. Since we are dealing with air a relatively low velocity (compared with the speed of sound), the air does no compress, it speeds up. Differences in construction techniques and artistic elements create a myriad of possibilities. The book is great for any flute player practicing scales. The exact sensitivity is determined from calibration and usually listed in the calibration certificate shipped with the sensor. The dimensions of the instrument are based on those of a large … [These vary the parameters of a uniform flue shape, after any ramp at the exit of the slow air chamber.] Curved vertical flue profile.

Your flute's cleaning rod has a handy measuring line on it to let you know that the cork is in place. The highlighted notes form the C major scale. The idea of the patent is to have a screw (#27 in the figure) that controls the depth of the flue and thus the tone of the flute. These diagrams and the recommendations for various dimensions provide a starting point for flute crafters. A common situation is a 90° edge created by two faces that is chamfered to create two 45° edges. Here is a table of measurements, including conversions from the published metric units.

Here's a list of major scales: C maj - 0 sharps. Generate lots of different readings. Flute makers typically call the diameter  of the bore (which forms the sound chamber) “D”. (personal communication, December 4, 2015): While the Flue–Taper Ratio can capture a gross measure of how much smaller the flue gets, there are several limitations: To explore the real-world effects of various flue profiles, Edward Kort carried out a number of studies, constructing hundreds of test flutes. sound chamber — a number close to, but not exactly, the physical length of the sound chamber. (Medium C to B Scales, Base C to B Scale and Base C to Higher Octave B Scales) Flute … Variations on flute scales. Flue–Width and Flue–Length. Increasing the backset (while keeping all other dimension the same) will lengthen the sound chamber and flatten all pitches, Multiplying by Measure 2.958 inches further down for the B pipe and make another mark. Please note that many extended scales are a bit more difficult to play, due to complex fingering. If typical accelerometer sensitivity is 100 mV/G and you measure a 10 G signal, you expect a 1000 mV or 1 V output. There is no one standard scale one can set on a flute. Arpeggios, broken chords and scales in thirds are three ways we can do this. For example, if the Sound Chamber–Diameter is 3⁄4″ (typical for flutes with fundamental notes of G4, G#4, and A4), then the recommended sound hole and flue width is 3⁄8″. [Historical note - I actually have since seen these measurements included in some advertisements!] The diagram a the left demonstates a rather exaggerated tapering of the flue in both depth and width.

Study 3. Select metric measurements, if you want to use it. G maj - 1 sharp . use a flue design than narrows in depth and/or width from the entrance point (where the air first enters the flue) to the exit point (at the sound hole). a recorder) the correction at the mouth can be approximated by L b = 2.3 a 2 / (area of fipple opening) 1/2 This shows that reducing Flue–Depth below a certain point has a dramatic effect on back-pressure. I'm going to make a full octave pan flute, so I need 13 tubes: C, C#/Db, D, D#/Eb, E, F, F#/Gb, G, G#/Ab, A, A#/Bb, B and C again. Enter the hole sizes. The factor which clearly defines a ratio scale is that it has a true zero point. At the top end of the pipe, place a slip coupling—a standard part used to join two lengths of pipe. And you can use these scales to accompany other instruments or entire bands with your the help of your own flute. I don't play flute but i know music. If the average breath pressures I measured across the mid-range flutes in a sample of 71 Native American flutes ranged from 2.24 to 6.50 cm H2O on the above graph ([Goss 2013] , Table 3, converted from mBar to cm H2O).

If you were able to cite down the flue, you would see the splitting edge or the Face Bevel positioned at some location vertically in your view. I varied both depths, splitting edge position, and bird end. A measure of the angle from the upper ramp to the longitudinal plane of the slow air chamber. The concert flutes all vary in octave, range and pitch. The depth is narrowed both by the canting of the base of the block downard toward the sound hole and the rising / thickening of the plug towards the sound hole. “makes notes in the first octave more solid, but notes in the second octave need some push” ([Gonzato 2015] , page 7).

I won’t lie to you – at first, it really is a challange. Longer flat sections had a poorer tone until it resolved to a clean tone with a long (2 times the flue width) flat section. Seller 100% positive. Increasing the width of the sound has a number of effects, based on newsgroups discussions with Michael Jones, Edward Kort, Daniel Bingamon, and Michael Prairie on March 28–29, 2016 Also applicable on multiple flutes in single order i.e. My personal belief is that less experienced players are better served with a smaller breath hole which produces a moderate amount of back-pressure, while more experienced players prefer a larger breath hole configuration which gives more direct control over the air pressure in the flue.
