After explaining things about his talk with Crocodile to the rest of the crew, Sanji revealed to them the Eternal Pose he swiped much to their delight. Following the rules of the game, Sanji was unfortunately made the ball of the Straw Hat team. After messing with the Maxim's gears, Sanji arrived just in time at the top deck to save Usopp and Nami from Enel. Sanji used a 'Diable Jambe: Flambage Shot' to give it serious damage, as Zoro activated his Asura technique to use his 'Asura: Makyuusen', right before Luffy activated Gear Third and finishes it off with a 'Gomu Gomu no Gigant Rifle'. Despite some initial success in the others fending him off, Sanji and the Straw Hats were defeated, and Nami was coerced into rejoining Shiki when he agreed not to harm her friends or home town. 	 Robin suddenly disappears in Episode 230, and she claims to Chopper and Sanji that she is parting ways with them in Epsiode 240. However, this did not end the threat to the city, as the bomb was revealed to be a time bomb and would explode anyway. Over dinner, Sanji was deeply appalled by Brook's bad manners as the skeleton explained his past. Though shortly after that, they heard a voice telling them to jump over into the sea and when they realized that it was the Going Merry, they jump together and finally escaped with the help Nami's navigation skills . 			 Later as the Saruyama Alliance and the Straw Hats were dining on Sanji's cooking, they realized that they needed something important to aid them, the South Bird. However before the pirates could do anything, they were intercepted by the White Berets.[107]. 	 Though Zoro was skillful, Sanji and the rest witness Luffy's companion fall to the master swordsman. Eventually, the crew reached Whisky Peak, where he noted that there was a good chance they would encounter some monsters since they were in the Grand Line. He then threw the food and the rat out of the palace, causing Sanji to cry. Swearing their dreams upon breaking the barrel, the Straw Hats sailed towards the Grand Line. With the crew shaken up by the incident, Sanji and the rest left Usopp with the Going Merry and rented a room in the city. However, Sanji is unable to accept the terms due to the honor debt he felt he owed to Zeff for saving his life as a small boy. His brothers eventually discovered he was still alive and occasionally visited the dungeon just to continue bullying him. Not even one of Sanji's kicks was able to damage Kuma (due to the fact that he is a cyborg, which no one knew at the moment), and so, Kuma decided to give the group a choice: Either die, or surrender Luffy to him. [87] However, this invoked the wrath of an entire herd of enormous adult Lapahn, who attempted to assault the two. They learned that Shiki was planning to let loose the animals on the island into East Blue in a gambit to force the surrender of the World Government. To his joy, Sanji's captain agreed and thus Sanji wasted no time in making Robin feel right at home. [27] Having escaped the kingdom, Sanji cut all ties with his family and renounced his title as a prince.[29][30]. Davy Jones' monstrous crew is made up from the doomed sailors who have opted to serve one hundred years before the mast rather than face certain death at sea. Have no worries, it's a happy ending.  Sanji and the Straw Hats attack a Pacifista. The rest of the crew later found him on the Thousand Sunny along with Zoro and Luffy decorated by the zombies. Sanji then found Robin had been attacked and held captive by Shiki's man ape, Scarlet.  	 SPOILERS ALERT !!!! After apparently escaping from the creatures and getting rid of a little stow away, Sanji and the rest learned of Jaya from an Eternal Pose that Robin stole. Monkey D. Luffy does not lie! With this knowledge, Sanji and the rest also realized what had happened to some pirates they had met earlier. [82], Eventually, Sanji regrouped with the rest of the crew together with a pair of giants they befriended. With this, the both of them went into the jungle to hunt. Luffy however told him to shut up and come with him, which got Chopper to join the crew after all. But that's just wut I think. [39], With his fighting skills learned from Zeff, Sanji was able to defeat a great deal of Krieg's men. Spurred by this, Sanji challenged Zoro to a hunting competition to see who could catch the bigger prey. I thought youd come up with a way of Pekoms persuading Big Mom to not come after Sanji, but you do realise your dumb plan will have Big Mom go after Baratie and Kamabaka. [49], After a few moments with the other chefs and with himself, Sanji packed his stuff and went to go with Luffy and Yosaku. Sanji landed the final blow in flipping Oars over, taking out his legs with an Anti-Manner Kick Course. All of them, except Luffy, rode Sodom and Gommorah to the Courthouse. [89], Upon regaining consciousness, Sanji attempted to capture Chopper, hoping to turn him into a stew for Nami to make her feel better. Two days ago, Sanji wrote a note for his crewmates, but while giving it to Nami, Chopper, and Brook, he seized the opportunity and threw them out of Capone Bege's body. Luffy caught the "Geezer Tree" while Franky caught the unicorn. Would Zoro have left the crew if he was in Sanji's place ? The fish-men threw a boulder at Luffy and Sanji shattered it with a kick to protect his friend. Great job Vinsmoke, keep those mighty fine theories up! Back to the Future (1985) cast and crew credits, including actors, actresses, directors, writers and more. Because of this ordeal, Sanji pledged to never refuse food to a starving individual, no matter how evil or poor they may be. There they had a little misunderstanding with Cricket and Sanji had a brief battle with him. Though dangerous, the starving pirate however was denied food from the other chefs and was kicked out of the restaurant. Sanji then battled Ivankov for a boat but did not prevail. Sanji lost the battle. As Sanji and the others were about to deal with Masira and his crew, they all suddenly found themselves in the presence of shadowy silhouettes of creatures much larger than normal giants. ... September 18, 2005 () March 15, 2014: Luffy and the others request that Robin comes back to the crew.  While Sanji and Zoro were more than capable to handle the situation they were in, their team however suffered a major setback. Having won the final round against Foxy, the Straw Hats were given the choice of picking one of the Foxy Pirates. I think she's going to put him in a situation where he breaks his rules. However due to Aokiji's Hie Hie no Mi Devil Fruit powers, Sanji ended up getting his leg frozen along with Luffy's arm and Zoro's sword.[120]. Ivankov also declared that he would refuse to tell Sanji anything about Luffy since there was the slightest chance of him being a spy for the government and the marines. If Pudding was evil and lieing about this whole thing or she were to die for him then the out come would be a sad and very missed up Sanji who wouldn't be the same. Though they defeated them, they unfortunately got a higher penalty than what they started out with. When Sanji was exhausted from his tense conversation with Ivankov, one of the okamas urged someone to put a dress on Sanji again.

There they met a skeleton named Brook whose being made Sanji ask a lot of questions. Sanji got up and noticed the Kuma clone has "PX-4" written on its neck, but before he could work out what it meant, a broadaxe-wielding warrior named Sentomaru appeared and ordered a Pacifista entitled "PX-1" to capture them. 40 Ubisoft points will give you 30,000 Crew Credits. Luffy also explained to him that Zeff did not save Sanji's life so that he could throw it away for the ship. As Sanji and the rest awaited for their turn and watched the first round of the games, they soon learned of the Foxy Pirate's cheating ways. As the feast continued, Brook told Sanji that he also saw what happened, and asked him for a song request that Brook would play on the piano. It was later revealed that he turned the lever to close the Gate of Justice, which in turn caused many whirlpools to appear that threw of the marines aim. Throughout the desert, Sanji got annoyed with Luffy's losing their food (first with the Kung-Fu Dugongs, then with the Warusagi Birds). 			 Love: Cook Pirates. One day, "Red Leg" Zeff, a pirate, and his crew, attacked the ship. He ended up redirecting a giant sized Gomu Gomu no Bazooka from hitting the unconscious Robin.
