The Density of an object is its mass per unit volume, the Mass is a physical quantity expressing the amount of matter in an object and the Volume is the quantity of three-dimensional space enclosed within an object. Answer: First, work out the volume of the rectangular prism by multiplying the three dimensions together, 50 multiplied by 40 multiplied by 10 to give 20,000 cm^3. Density is calculated by dividing the mass of a substance by the volume (density = mass/volume). In optics, the refractive index (also known as refraction index or index of refraction) of a material is a dimensionless number that describes how fast light travels through the material. The density â¦ Density = Mass/Volume Volume of a Rectangular Prism = L x W x H Volume of a Cylinder = 1/4 ï»¿ Ï d^2 Experimental Technique: To determine density, we first must calculate the mass of each object using a digital balance. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment. It lies with its base horizontal.
