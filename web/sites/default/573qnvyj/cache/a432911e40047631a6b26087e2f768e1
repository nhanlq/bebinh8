The IP address of a WSL2 machine cannot be made static, however it can be determined using wsl hostname -I. This script does basically two things: Provide a way to update what host.wsl resolves to within WSL (by updating the hosts file of host). Press question mark to learn the rest of the keyboard shortcuts Virtualized network interfaces mean that WSL2 network instances can hold different IP configurations than their Windows 10 counterparts. First, and hopefully the easiest, WSL2 supports mDNS (WSL1 did not), so you should be able to access the Windows host as {hostname}.local (where {hostname} is the name of the Windows host (literally, in bash, ping $(hostname).local, since the assigned WSL2 hostname is that of the host Windows 10 computer). Intro WSL2. Yes, in general networking applications will be faster and work better since we have full system call compatibility. Maybe helpful for others, since WSL 2 writes the host ip address into /etc/resolv.conf and I rely on running an X Server on my Windows host I have … Press J to jump to the feed. I am thinking I can run a shell script in WSL2 at boot that will write the WSL2 machine's address to a file on the host system. This way, we don’t have to update our PHPStorm configuration with the correct IP address every time. This means that in initial preview builds WSL 2 will behave more similarly to a virtual machine, e.g: WSL 2 will have a different IP address than the host machine. That works for me. Due to the architecture change in WSL 2, you are not able to do that out of the box. Run the task and check hosts file to see if WSL IP address is added. A powershell script will look for that file, and when it finds it it will run: netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=4000 listenaddress=0.0.0.0 connectport=4000 connectaddress=<WSL2 IP> So we need a way to identify this IP address after each reboot. Here in this section it says: To access a Windows network application you'll need to use the IP address of your host machine. @PavelSosin-320 there are several different networks in the context and both of your host and WSL have multiple IP addresses. However, the new architecture uses virtualized networking components. WSL program manager Craig Loewen has stated in a WSL2 bug post that in order for the localhost to work, a server needs to be accessible to all IP address … Windows Subsystem for Linux is aimed to be a Linux (POSIX like runtime environment inside Windows10) In WSL1 it is a redirection of OS calls to underlying OS In WSL2 it is a Linux kernel (real … Now we can access servers running on … Here comes the (a bit) more tricky part. Objective is to Make WSL2-hosted server listening on Win10 external IP (by default, WSL server listens on “localhost”) WSL2 inside Windows10 (Build 18980 and more). ; Create firewall rule so that WSL can access host via their shared network. Also restart WSL instance using: # shutdown wsl --shutdown # start wsl A PowerShell window should pop up and update the IP address. IIRC, previously in WSL 1, you can access the host (Windows) database from inside WSL. Ideally, a dynamic entry in hosts file that will map “wsl2.host” to this IP address.  Based on this I was able to create the following powershell script that will start sshd on my WSL machine and route traffic to it.
