As the water begins filling the toilet’s tank, check for leaks around the new valve. If you’re working on one of these and the shut-off valve isn’t working, you can simply use the main shut-off valve to stop the flow of water … Turning off the water simplifies things for you as the tank won’t be refilling. Loosen A Stuck Shut Off Valve There’s nothing worse than getting ready to start a plumbing project only to realize that you can’t turn off the water supply. The water level in the tank is controlled by an adjustable float. Usually, you will have to turn the water valve clockwise to shut it off. Do not use any of the old toilet valve parts, such as the hex nuts or brass compression rings, with the new valve to prevent mismatching that might cause leakage. I have a 1995 Fleetwood Bounder with a Thetford Aquamagic toilet. 1. If your toilet fill valve won't shut off, you've got a running toilet, and that has more than one possible cause.In fact, the culprit might not be the fill valve at all, but the flush valve, because, if it's leaking, the fill valve has to keep running to maintain the water level in the tank. You will need to shut off the water supply to your whole house / apartment to fix it. 2. My question is if I lift the toilet so I can turn it is there a … After switching off the water, the next step is to drain the water in the tank. 1. The toilet keeps running.  Call your neighborhood plumber today and we’ll get your water flowing smoothly again! That will take care of shutting off the water so you can work on the toilet. The filler won't shut off so I'm sure the valve needs to be replaced. Step 2: Drain the tank. The plus is you can get compression fittings (provided the pipe is copper and the right size) in most cases. Plumbing valves have a way of freezing up over time, and that can make it difficult to do even the simplest repairs. Fortunately, flappers are among the easiest toilet parts to replace, so even the novice plumber can quickly repair a toilet that's not shutting off when the tank is filled. Open the water main in the house then loosen the toilet shut-off valve by turning it counterclockwise. Step 1 Turn the toilet tank's water supply valve to the "off" position. Tighten the nut snug so that the valve still turns. Everything is in the back so I can't see anything. Shut off the water outside the toilet. Then remove the handle and the nut holding the stem in the valve. A lot of these have screw on handles, and I did have one that came loose. Put a new washer on the end of the stem and on the shaft. The most common flush valve component to fail is the flapper, an oblong rubber plug that raises and lowers with every push … Valve is fine, the handle isn't. The valve should not be difficult to turn, so don’t try to force it if you can’t easily turn it. Many fixtures and appliances in a home have their own shut-off valves, such as toilets, sinks, the dishwasher, and the water heater. You're going to have to shut off water to the house, remove/cut the damn thing off, and put on a new valve. Turning the valve clockwise as far as it can go will turn off the water supply to the toilet. The valve died. If the water valve looks rusty or is difficult to turn, try applying some WD-40 to it.
