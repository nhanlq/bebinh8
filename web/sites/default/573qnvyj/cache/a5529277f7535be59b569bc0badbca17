An interesting test would have been to retard and then advance the 110-degree LSA cam by four degrees. Widening their separation angle helps increase upper rpm power output. And by performance I mean 1/4 ET. A concrete result of this apple-to-oranges comparison is that the roller cranked out over 20 lb-ft and 20 hp more average power with a peak horsepower difference well over 60 hp. They are identical except one is on a 112 lobe sep and one is on a 114 lobe sep. Pump gas 91-93, stealth cnc'd heads. All rights reserved. 'Currently listening to: "Top Fuel Armageddon" by The Spectres. As you can see, there are a number of variables present in each and every camshaft that can be used to dial in the ultimate power in a street or race engine. 114 lsa vs. 112 lsa on an Auto. The difficulty with doing this story is coming up with a fair comparison, which in reality is not easy because the mechanical cam has lash figures of 0.016 and 0.018 inch, which do not allow comparing advertised duration at, say, 0.006-inch of tappet lift. The follow-up question then becomes, is the gain worth the additional price of the roller? Their weak numbers meant the this engine wanted to breath with some overlap to make its best power. 'Read faster. It measured 232° on the intake lobe with the lobe positioned at 104° (the 041 intake is 231° at 112°) and 239° with the exhaust lobe at 116° (the 041 is 240° at 115°). After all, the engine doesn't know what logo is stamped on the valve cover. ... View Dyno Graph for 112 LSA. For example, an oval-track small-block that needs to motivate the car off the turns quickly might have a narrow LSA of around 106 degrees, resulting in more overlap. While most car crafters will recognize that this is anything but a fair fight, the concept was not to see who wins, but rather how much of a difference the mechanical roller cam is worth. Now that you have an idea of what lift and duration are, let’s muddy things up by comparing flat tappet and roller lifter cams. “The lobe separation angle is the angle in camshaft degrees between the maximum lift points, or centerlines, of the intake and exhaust lobes,” says Eric Bolander of Erson Cams. Degreeing a CamIf you've read more than two engine-buildup stories in your lifetime, then you've no doubt been exposed to the concept of degreeing the camshaft. Here, the guys at Westech bolted a mild 350ci small-block Chevy to the dyno equipped with a Comp Cams Xtreme Energy 268 hydraulic flat-tappet cam, stock stamped-steel rockers, a set of TFS 23-degree aluminum heads with 2.02/1.60-inch valves, an Edelbrock Performer RPM intake, a Barry Grant 750-cfm Speed Demon carb, and a set of 151/48-inch headers feeding into a 211/42-inch Flowmaster exhaust. The bartender can't help but ask, "What's with the steering wheel?" On page 52 of that issue he shows one of his dyno graphs, comparing the results of a 106* LSA cam vs a 112* LSA cam in a 505ci, 700 hp BBC. Other people would like to use the bathroom, you know. small-block Chevy, but the results would be reinforced with almost any engine configuration. The lumpy-idling 101 LSA cam churned out an average of 484.0 hp at 6,100 rpm with 493.9 lb-ft of torque at 4,400 rpm. Each engine will respond a little differently to these changes, but this test illustrates how overlap does have a positive affect on power. The 224R camshaft is available in a wide variety of lobe separations. Anything with a 112, 113 or 114 degree lobe separation is great for blowers and nitrous. Instead, see what trends you can pick up from the testing and then apply these same concepts to your next engine. It has; by far, the Advancing the cam would have placed the intake closing at the 106-degree cam position. Our contention is that the 114-degree LSA's better top-end power came as a result of the later-closing intake valve and not because of the reduced overlap. It has 7 inches of vacuum with a Lunati hydraulic roller cam that lifts 0.629-629 with duration of 250 in, 255 ex., 110 centerline and 112 LSA. .454/.454 110 LSA Crane energized smaller: 210/210, .440/.440 110 LSA Crane powermax: 204/216 .427/.454 112 LSA Build your own custom newsletter with the content you love from EngineLabs, directly to your inbox, absolutely FREE! Clearly, the better cylinder heads that flowed 250 cfm at 0.500-inch lift offer proof as to why this test was successful. The mechanical roller comes in with almost 0.070 inch more max valve lift that certainly contributes to the significant power increase inherent with a mechanical roller cam. We started with a typical 350ci small-block Chevy equipped with a stock-style flat-tappet hydraulic cam. Today, you have to look for a reason not to run a set, especially when you read this test that originally ran in the January '01 issue. All rights reserved. When you can get all that for under $250, that's a win, baby. Alternatively, if you are running a bigger camshaft to gain maximum top-end power, cam makers often suggest reducing the lobe separation angle to recover power lost in the lower rev range.” They offer two versions of it. The same is true for intake valve closing. Going beyond this intake duration pushes peak power up past the 6,500 rpm range and starts to hurt torque production.

A wide LSA reduces valve overlap, softens the idle and improves overall drivability–especially on the street where performance engines benefit from 112 to 114 LSA. This is why you will often see bigger cams with a wider LSA, which is an attempt to limit the amount of overlap. I don't know how differently my cam (10:1 454 256/260 @ .050 112 LSA) would have responded to a 110 or even a 108, but since its 95% street, I'm not after every hp, just a goal I've yet to reach. Lobe Separation Angle TestIn another dyno flog, we tested three cams in the same small-block Chevy with the only change being the lobe separation angle (LSA). This cam actually uses an intake centerline of 108 and an exhaust centerline of 112 degrees for an LSA of 110 degrees (108 + 112 = 220/2 = 110 degrees). “It’s also critical that valve overlap is kept to a minimum as the induction system can create a suction that pulls water into the motor,” adds Bolander. Cam, Sinister 230/236 .591"/.601" 112 LSA Camshaft (recommended for LS1, LS6, LS2 engines only) This camshaft features Comp Cams XER lobes! By clicking Sign Up, you agree to the  Terms of Use. Because the stock cam made such good torque, the bigger cam actually lost torque between 2,000 and 3,000 but compensated with a ton more power between 4,000 and 5,900 rpm. The first special cam (cam #1) was specified with a duration similar to the Pontiac 041, but with a tighter lobe separation of 110°, vs. the 113.5° of the 041. Just for a comparrison my 454 +.030 runs ported Oval Edelbrock Ovals, Vicotor Jr, Holley 1000 and a solid roller (255 / 262 at .050 .652 lift on a 112 LSA installed at 110.5 ICL) the car goes 125 mph in the 1/4 on the motor (approx 3450 lbs). The following chart reveals the power increases that generally track right along with the ratio. The Torquer V2 camshafts use lobes that are designed to be both beehive & double valve spring friendly. Those results would have allowed us to see the difference between overlap and the effect of intake closing. A 232 deg duration cam with a 108 deg LCA will have the same valve overlap as a 236 deg cam with a 110 deg LCA and idle will probably be very similar. Chuck Lawrence of Jon Kaase Racing Engines was asked to give a 520ci BBF a “Pro Stock” sound, so he went with a 108 LSA in place of a more conventional 112 LSA. Narrow LSA cams weren't really much of an option 2 years ago because of the lack of tuning. If a street car has smaller lift and duration numbers, they might run 112 or 114. But comparing Comps cams I would think the 110* lsa cam would make more torque in the under 5000 rpm range it would operate with 1500-3500 being the most important to get on plane. “The tighter the lobe separation angle, the peakier the power curve will be,” confirms Bolander. Of course, the opposite is also true when widening the LSA. How much power or whether you would really care in a street car is a question better left to someone who knows. An RV or towing camshaft, which is considered a mild performance or an economy cam, will often have a narrower LSA, between 112 and 114 degrees. The catalog description is identical for both. Valve lift will bear weight in any decision regarding LSA. Mike Magda is a veteran automotive writer with credits in publications such as Racecar Engineering, Hot Rod, Engine Technology International, Motor Trend, Automobile, Automotive Testing Technology and Professional Motorsport World. The duration-at-0.050 numbers indicate that the mechanical roller is much "bigger" but most of that is inherent in the roller design, the exact concept this test was intended to evaluate. Where else can you bolt on something simple like a set of rocker arms in about an hour that will add an average of 15 lb-ft of torque and 13 hp? The best way to approach this story is to not get caught up in the fact that most of these tests were performed on a small-block Chevy. Effect Of Changes In Cam Timing And Lobe Separation Angle The following tables illustrate how variations in lobe separation angle and cam timing will effect the behavior of the engine in which the camshaft is installed. While these two cams might have the same LSA, the longer-duration cam … This is a discussion on 114 lsa vs. 112 lsa on an Auto within the Internal Engine forums, part of the LSx Technical Help Section category; I'm trying to decide if I should go with a 114 lsa or 112 lsa on the cam I'm getting. Keep in mind that this particular test moved both the intake and exhaust lobes when increasing the lobe separation angle from 106 to 114 degrees. A Pro Stock engine builder may prefer a wide LSA to help keep the power from breaking traction tOo early. The price you pay for this would be greatly reduced bottom-end torque and a more erratic idle. Hydraulic Flat-Tappet vs. © 2020 Power Automedia. All other things being equal. Granted, not all engines will respond as this one did. We'll let you decide. Again, these are general bits of conventional wisdom. Flat Tappet vs. Roller. “Also, the wider LSA contributes to chassis stability in drag racing by avoiding the delivery of a ferocious blast of power that would break tire traction. Howards Cams, American Muscle Hydraulic Flat Tappet Camshaft, Chevy SB 262-400, 194/203 @ .505, .390/.410, 112 LS Chevrolet Small Block 262-400 Cam Series: American Muscle Budget Cam SwapNot all of our testing involves high-end, mega-dollar stuff. The 273Lr cam featured a .610/.617 lift split, a 223/231-degree duration split, and 112-degree lsa. They pretty much followed the theory that advancing the camshaft improved bottom-end torque, while retarding the cam from the zero or "straight up" position hurts bottom-end power while slightly improving power at higher engine speeds. The test was a simple comparison of stock stamped-steel 1.5:1 ratio rockers to a set of Comp Cams Pro Magnum steel 1.5:1 and 1.6:1 rockers and a 1.65:1 ratio Comp High Energy aluminum rockers. 232/234.600"/.600" 112 LSA. Why this is important is the subject of a Marlan Davis test from the February '98 issue where he performed a series of three tests on the same engine on Flowmaster's Superflow dyno in which the only variable was to advance or retard the camshaft. The point of all this is that you should be aware of what the cam companies are doing before you decide to make changes. Can you use a performance cam with a 110 or a 108 LSA? We'll send you raw engine tech articles, news, features, and videos every week from EngineLabs. If a street car has smaller lift and duration numbers, they might run 112 or 114. Selecting a camshaft for a given engine’s purpose usually involves a compromise between low- or high-end power options, and the lobe separation angle (LSA) is one of those factors where engine builders have to make a choice between those priorities. This conclusion is further supported by the relatively poor performance of the wider 112 and 114 LSA cams. As an example my winter refresh which included a .5 increase in compression and cam change to one with a 109 LSA vs a 112 and a fairly serious increase in .200 duration netted about 160 HP with .050 duration figures that changed less than 2 degrees. A narrower LCA will increase valve overlap and close the (intake) valve earlier, which explains the typical rougher idler and more midrange behaviour. Most cam grinders will use a middle of the range 110/112 degrees for street motors. Ive got it narrowed down to probably: Edelbrock: 204int/214 exh, .420/.442 lift, 112 LSA Crane energizer: 216/216. This also changed the opening and closing points for both the intake and exhaust. That tells you this is a substantial gain. 8620 CAM CORES OUT OF STOCK . A cam ground with zero advance will always have an intake centerline equal to the LSA, which in this case is 110 degrees. For example: 110 + 114 = 224/2 = 112 degrees LSA. Roller-Rocker TestThere was a time when aluminum roller rockers were a status symbol of only the most elite road race or drag race engine. I should go with a 112/114 LSA cam for this car? The 110 cam made our highest peak horsepower of the day at 539, five up from the 104 cam and seven up from the 114. This test does point out the power of a well-matched package of cam and valvetrain. This means the cam is actually ground with 2 degrees of advance built in. The 106 LSA cam scavenged too much, and the 110 LSA cam couldn’t scavenge enough, but the 108 LSA cam scavenged just right. One segment that truly benefits from a wider LSA is the marine marine market. Basically, a bone-stock set of heads would probably not have gained as much as this combination. Bolander says those cams help promote torque in a controlled and predictable manner, especially in no-wake zones and around the docks. 'We've tested a lot of cam and valvetrain components in the past few years and have decided to give you an education by reviewing some of the more interesting results we've found and condense it into data you can use for your next engine project. My question is concerning the Comp XE270 cam. I saw similar results with my new cam. Why is the least trained, lowest paid tech working on … Hot street camshafts usually have 110- to 112-degree LSA, while high performance and racing camshafts will … Those are numbers that are hard to ignore as long as your wallet can accommodate the price of admission.  If we add the exhaust closing and intake opening point numbers at 0.050-inch tappet lift, this will deliver actual overlap at that checking height as shown in the chart. In most street cam examples, that advance has already been done for you. Solid Roller: Comp Cams XR286R Gross duration: Intake 286, Exhaust 292 Duration @.050": Intake 248, Exhaust 254 Gross valve lift: Intake .576", Exhaust .582 LSA 110 LSA gives it the lumpyness low LSA 108/110 gives a very nice lump higher the LSA the smoother it is standard is 119 I think it can also be tuned to be more lumpy as well. The most popular options customers select is either the 112LSA or the wider 114LSA. The cam companies emphasize this process so the builder knows that the camshaft is properly phased with the engine. As you add duration to the intake and exhaust lobes while retaining the same LSA, the number of degrees of overlap will increase even with the same LSA. Page 1 of 3 1 2 3 Next > May 13, 2007 #1 ... Theoretically, the wider LCA cam should raise both ends of your power curves some and drop their peaks down some so basically it widen's the usable power range. Basically, the wider (114-degree) lobe separation angle lost torque in the midrange compared to the tighter 106-degree LSA but made up ground with top-end power. The lobe separation angle or LSA is the angle in camshaft degrees between the maximum lift points, or centerlines, of the intake and exhaust lobes.The lobe separation angle or LSA is the angle in camshaft degrees between the maximum lift points, or centerlines, of the intake and exhaust lobes. So would a smaller cam out perform the next step up with the wider LSA? The combination of the two points, plus some overlap, are clearly the reasons why this inexpensive cam swap was worth an honest 77 peak horsepower. The XER lobes have been proven to make big horsepower & torque thanks to their aggressive ramp rates & healthy lift. For instance, you can have a 220-at-0.050 cam and a 280-at-0.050, both on 110-degree LSAs. This lobe spread is designed and ground into the camshaft and can only be changed by grinding another camshaft, unless you're working with a dual overhead cam (DOHC) motor, in which case you can move the intake cam or the exhaust cam or both to change the lobe spread all you want. 228/228 .600 .600 110 lsa how would this perform against a regular tsp 228r cam (228/228 .588/.588 112 lsa)? “Lobe separation angles,” he continues, “are influenced by the camshaft grind. Your information will be collected and used in accordance with our  Privacy Policy, Gains are expressed compared to the stock stamped rocker baseline. Retarding the cam would maintain the overlap yet put the intake closing point at the 45-degree ABDC that would duplicate the 114-degree test. It had a robust powerband with tons of usable torque. The test was performed on a (what else?) We've also tested some very easy-on-the-wallet deals like this flat-tappet cam swap for a mere $245.67, including the cost of the gaskets. One thing to keep in mind is that many cam manufacturers build in a certain amount of advance when grinding the camshaft. The Erson also added a whopping 0.082 and 0.062 inch of valve lift. That's probably the lesson here-that stock heads will not benefit as much from more lift compared to ported or aftermarket heads. The most popular options customers select is … 'Button C on the steering wheel of Speed Racer's Mach 5 activates rotary saws that cut down all obstacles in the car's path. Alternatively, if you are running a bigger camshaft to gain maximum top-end power, cam makers often suggest reducing the lobe separation angle to recover power lost in the lower rev range.”. So the wider LSA introduces a broader and therefore longer torque band.”. But that doesn’t mean high-strung racing engines can’t see gains, as well. This particular Crane cam uses a recommended intake centerline of 108 degrees while the lobe separation angle (LSA) is 110 degrees. This tends to improve top-end power. We will safeguard your e-mail and only send content you request. 1800-6800 RPM Power Band; This is an excellent performance camshaft with an agressive idle! power diff 110 vs 114 lsa Discussion in 'High Performance Modifications' started by sleepybu, May 13, 2007. Is this truly a fair test? A narrow, more specific power band is also a product of a narrow LSA, as is a lumpy idle quality–often referred to as the 106 sound. Nitrous engines, which make plenty of power and torque, often run wide lobe separation angles to moderate cylinder pressures and temperatures. A 2.0 pinto with 44.45mm inlets would be 108* LSA going by the chart which is about optimum I think, and 110* LSA with 46mm inlets, also quite close to what is needed This cam actually uses an intake centerline of 108 and an exhaust centerline of 112 degrees for an LSA of 110 degrees (108 + 112 = 220/2 = 110 degrees). “It affects the amount of valve overlap; that is the brief period of time when both the intake and exhaust valves are open.”. The best indicator of all is the 44hp average power increase over the entire rpm band. “On a naturally aspirated engine, the lobe separation angle has an effect on whether the engine reaches peak torque a little earlier or later in the rpm range. With lower duration also comes lower lift. The 224R camshafts use lobes that are designed to be both beehive & double valve spring friendly. The wider angles would be helpful with nitrous oxide or a blower motor on alcohol (blower motor on gasoline works best at 110 degree LSA) or an EFI motor. Again, much depends on the overall engine combination and intended use, but as a general rule, cams with a 110-to 112- degree LSA offer good power and decent street manners. The final compression test revealed 174 psi on the gauge—right in between our first two cams. It turns out that I actaully gained top end and low end over the previous cam that I had that was on a 114 LSA. "Arr," answers the pirate, "It's drivin' me nuts!". “If you changed the lobe separation of a street engine from 112 degrees to 106 and didn’t do anything else,” adds Kaase. 'Latest E-Mail Joke: A pirate walks into a bar with an enormous steering wheel sticking out from the front of his trousers. For Cyber Monday we are offering free shipping on all TSP Exhaust parts, and our Cams and Cam Packages remain on sale through the end of the day! “The result sounded wonderful, but it didn’t rev as enthusiastically and it made 30 less horsepower than normal,” says Lawrence. With the engine on the dyno at Westech, it peaked at 326 hp at a mere 4,700 rpm with impressive torque at 398 lb-ft at 3,700 rpm. * These are net lift numbers-lobe lift  rocker ratio minus hot-lash clearance. Since the intake closing is the most important, note that the 114-degree LSA also creates the latest intake closing point. This is defined as the spread in camshaft degrees between the intake and exhaust lobe centerlines and can be determined by adding the intake and exhaust lobe centerline figures together and dividing by 2. Regardless of engine design, this spread determines overlap, which affects idle quality, midrange torque, as well as top-end power. Customer with our 228R Cam on a 112 LSA, and Texas Speed Headers with X Pipe. © 2017 Power Automedia. “Changing the lobe separation angle changes the amount of overlap that exists during the time the intake and exhaust valves are both open,” echoes Doug Patton of Pro Line Race Engines. The valvesprings were also clearly overworked even with the stock cam, so the swap included a set of new Erson single-wound springs as well. So just lets say the 225/230 cam with 525 lift and 110 LSA would out perform a 230/236 540 lift with 112 LSA? Next, we jumped in with an Erson TQ40H mild flat hydraulic cam and lifter package along with a new set of springs to replace the tired originals. “Supercharged and nitrous race engines typically benefit from a wider LSA because they don’t require as much overlap for exhaust scavenging as does the naturally aspirated engine,” continues Bolander. On a torque graph it tends to resemble a triangular shape.”. Getting back to the sound of an engine, it’s no secret that a raucous, lumpy idle is often preferred by street cruisers, regardless of the ill manners and inefficiency of such an engine setup. Advancing the cam further in this case did not improve overall power compared to the zero baseline, although it did pump up the torque down low. Wider LSA's usually idle better and are more streetable, check the cam specs on new motors (LS-1's etc.) When boost or nitrous are introduced, and engine builders contemplate choices between single-, dual- or reverse-pattern camshafts — then the discussion gets much more technical. Mechanical RollerThis test originally appeared in our November '00 issue with the plan to pit a typical flat-tappet hydraulic cam against a more aggressive mechanical roller. “The engine would idle a lot rougher and generate worse exhaust emissions largely because of unburned fuel.”. The included cam-specs chart indicates how much more aggressive the mechanical roller cam is merely by evaluating the differences in valve lift. Typically, narrower lobe separation develops peak torque at lower rpm and widening the separation tends to build peak torque higher in the rpm range. The Verdict: Looking at the three dyno curves (see sidebar 2) the 104 LSA cam looks like the clear winner. Widening their separation angle helps increase upper rpm power output. It affects the amount of valve overlap; that is the brief period of time … The Erson cam added a solid 23 degrees of duration on the intake side and 26 degrees on the exhaust side, both measured at 0.050-inch tappet lift. Originally, on startup I ran gasoline 93 and a Barry Grant 850cfm with no problem but the carb was noticeably small for this engine. I went with a 112 LSA and everyone told me I wouldn't make any low end. LSA 106 This is a very good baseline solid cam that I have used alot and is a proven performer. What the testing showed us is that a tighter lobe separation angle (like 106 degrees) was worth more average power and more peak power than a wider lobe separation angle (like 114 degrees). Engine builders Chuck Lawrence, left, and Doug Patton. We promise not to use your email address for anything but exclusive updates from the Power Automedia Network. The Torquer V2 camshaft is available in a wide variety of lobe separations. That’s just the way the customer wants to roll, and engine builders find it’s easy to deliver such a powerplant. The guinea pig for this test was a Steve Dulcich-built 440ci Mopar using a set of ported mid-'70s 742 iron castings, a Mopar Performance M-1 intake, an 850-cfm Barry Grant Speed Demon carb, and a set of 171/48-inch Hooker headers flowing through a pair of Flowmaster mufflers. “It produces peak torque earlier—coming on quicker and stronger—but also it falls off quicker too. He doesn't make clear any other build specs on the motor, but the accompanying text, as well as the graph, indicate that the 106* LSA cam made 21 more hp, and 30 more ft lbs peak, than the 112* LSA cam. This tends to support the idea that a tighter LSA with a later-closing intake would be the best of both worlds. The basics of what you want in a nitrous (or supercharger) friendly cam is a wider lobe separation than what most “performance” or “race” cams have. They also reduce stress on the outdrive. It's also important to remember that LSA is a mere angle.
