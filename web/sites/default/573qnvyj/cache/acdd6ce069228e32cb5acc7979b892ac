Consistent with its strong desiccating power, P4O10 is used in organic synthesis for dehydration. So your compound is covalent because P (Phosphorus) is a An inorganic compound is typically a chemical compound that lacks C-H bonds, that is, a compound that is not an organic compound, but the distinction is not defined or even of particular interest. This problem has been solved! That is why it is called phosphorus anhydride at times. Atoms forming compounds form ionic or covalent bonds. Computing molecular weight (molecular mass) To calculate molecular weight of a chemical compound enter it's formula, specify its isotope mass number after each element in square brackets. C=40%, H=6.67%, O=53.3%) of the compound. Nomenclature of ionic compound: The Name of the cation is written first.
