(Now I’m just imagining people trying to distill whole ears of corn, what a disaster!) Kentucky Straight Bourbon is a designation for bourbons made specifically in Kentucky. Then they will mix them, age them, and otherwise make them their own at their warehouses. Neat and straight mean the same thing – no ice. So far the match is a draw. The richness and caramel are still very present and add a lovely layer. As long as the mash is at least 51% corn, it’s bourbon! To me, Knob Creek is a he-man's bourbon, something to drink when camping or socked in at a woodsy lodge on a cold winter night. But they also have a rye whisky, a malt whisky, a wheat whisky, and a double oaked whisky (aged twice in two different barrels). Keep in mind a “low-end bottle” of Scotch is around $60. Needless to say, the stuff my friends had at school didn't compare. In many fancier establishments, larger rocks are used because they melt and dilute the bourbon less quickly while keeping it cool for longer!
