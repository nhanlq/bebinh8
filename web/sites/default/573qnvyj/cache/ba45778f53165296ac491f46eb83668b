This is a question that maybe only a physician can answer. Secondly, it is our hospital protocol (and many others) to not give results out over the phone - even a good one, because we are not medically trained and leave ourselves (and the hospital) open for liable action. Mostly the consultant tells me, yes, just read them to the patient. I called my doctor's office in order to receive my blood test results. I know that the doctor was probably just trying to make me feel better before the biopsy, said Ms. Perry, but the doctor s failure to address her concerns before she received the bad news made absorbing it … He said he could not give my blood test results over the phone and that only the doctor could do this. 2 How should results of HIV testing be communicated: On the phone or in a "face-to-face” visit? Hearing the news over the phone left Perry shaken and tearful from fear and frustration. Every time I get results back I ALWAYS ask the consultant if I can give out the results if the patient rings. Some doctors are charging for phone calls that were once considered an incidental and nonbillable part of a previous office visit. On the other hand, if the physician is adjusting medication, recommending surgery, or anything that requires more than a 1-2 of minutes of phone time, this will require a return visit. The viral load can be detected within 9 to 11 days of exposure. 1 The best practice is to convey an HIV test result face-to-face.  Can an RN or an LPN give negative diagnostic results over the phone or in person to a patient? Nothing is left just lying round. Many docs prefer to discuss positive results face-to-face so treatment can begin at once & preventive advice can be given. My GP's receptionist told me the same thing, they don't like to give results out over the phone anymore as they can't answer any questions you may have and they don't want to say the wrong thing. I spoke to the orthopedist's ortho assistant. Dear Donna replies: Dear Wondering, I’m assuming that by “negative,” you mean normal or no pathology found. 1) Many places will simply NEVER give results over the phone, whether good or bad. Most prefer to discuss all results of HIV test in person so reassurance can be provided, options for treatment, need to tell partners & have them treated. Dear LucyB All the results to be dictated on will be in order of priority of that I can assure you. The CDC provides clear direction on how test results should be delivered. Negative results r often reported by phone (except for HIV test). Blood tests and MRI are two different things, therefore they could have two different policies. He said I should schedule an appointment to get my blood test results. Clearly, a doctor or a doctor's office shouldn't call and leave a message on the answering machine. Wondering. <p>Regarding the OP comment, we will give normal results over the phone without requiring the patient to return. If he says no, then I would say, 'sorry I don't have access to that, but I'll get them to you or your GP as soon as I can, or my consultant will call you'.
