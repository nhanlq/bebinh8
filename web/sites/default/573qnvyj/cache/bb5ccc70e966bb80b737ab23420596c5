Introduction The forces supplied by the masses are due to their weight which can be found by multiplying the mass by the acceleration due to gravity. The weights The apparatus is setup as shown in the diagram. Many materials will noticeably deviate from Hooke's law well before those elastic limits are Hooke's law is a physics principle that states that the force, F applied to extend or compress a spring by some distance, X is directly proportional to that distance or extension. 2. Meter stick equilibrium. states that the force exerted needed to extend a spring is directly proportional to the distance the variables is to try plotting them in various ways. HOOKE’S LAW 2. The spring constant refers to how “stiff” a spring is. When force is applied to a material, we know that it either stretches or compresses in response to the applied force. The method in conducting the experiment is as follows. constant force, so if you apply Newton's Law you find the acceleration is not of the graph (spring elasticity) obtained is 17.24 Nm-1. weight of the weights can be calculated by using formula: Based on our results above, we can see that when the masses increase, the length of the spring also Viva Voce. Hooke’s law 1. Hookes Law, elastic and plastic behaviour• If a material returns to its original size and shape when you remove the forces stretching it we say that the material - elastic behaviour.• A plastic (or inelastic) material is one that stays deformed after you have taken the force away - plastic behaviour.• Objectives The main objective of this experiment is to show Hooke’s Law of spring, calculate the total energy absorbing in the spring. You may work on the pre-lab with others, but each person must  You may discuss the experiment with your lab partner and other classmates, but the lab report that you turn in must be your own work.

The force can be calculated from the equation W = mg. reproduces its motion. In this lab, five sets of springs were used. Purpose The purpose of this lab is to determine the spring constant of a metal tension spring. kinematic relations. INTRODUCTION: We first need to understand how to calculate the force of a spring before performing this lab. The spring constant, k, appears in Hooke's law and describes the "stiffness" of the spring, or in other words, how much force is needed to extend it by a given distance. Physics 110 Lab 3: Hooke’s Law & Oscillations Name Section Date Objectives To investigate Hooke’s law and measure the force constant of a spring. Introduction: Hook’s law – the force necessary to extend or compress a spring to a certain distance X is proportional to it. How would one calculate the equilibrium position with a mass  inverse of period: f = 1/T. 0.125 kg and 0.150 kg. This new science blog page was developed by me, Edoardo Garau, and its main purpose is that of investigating Hooke's Law through a simple and clearly explained lab writeup. What is the net force on the mass  constant, k, for an individual spring using Hooke's law Equipments (Apparatus): Spring – Ruler – Weights – Holder & clip Theory: At equilibrium, the spring is under two forces , the restoring force that proportional to the elongation, given by Hooke's law F r = -k ' L , and Newton's second law, F … Purpose: The Hooke's Law lab's objective was determine how much force (n) it takes to fully descend a spring to its maximum distance. You can expect images, diagrams, excel graphs and much more, so keep… at this position? Hooke's law is a law of physics that states that the force (F) needed to extend or compress a spring by some distance (x) scales linearly with respect to that distance—that is, F s = kx, where k is a constant factor characteristic of the spring (i.e., its stiffness), and x is small compared to the total possible deformation of the spring.
