Set up a ramp using the metal track and a bunch of books at any angle so that the ball will roll off. on a Ball Rolling Down a Ramp Aim: I am trying to find out what factors effect the distance a ball rolls when released from the top of a ramp. Use the data to fill out the following table for Trial 1; Repeat steps for Trials 2 and 3. The speed when it starts will not … Since free falling is essentially equivalent to a completely vertical ramp, he assumed that a ball rolling down a ramp would speed up in the exact same way as a falling ball would. They use the scientific method with a problem to solve, a hypothesis to make and test, and an experiment to run. Galileo's experimental apparatus was simple; it consisted of a wooden ramp with a groove cut into it and a bronze ball. L5: There is a constant acceleration along the ramp. What will be its acceleration? you will roll a small ball down a ramp and determine the ballвЂ™s velocity with a Motion Detector placed near the upper Expanding Science Labs into Science Projects. Next, you will see again the ball at rest over the plane and in the same initial position as before. Grades: 7 th, 8 th, 9 th, 10 th. Our team hypothesized that if the height of the ramp is increased, the table tennis ball will generate more acceleration as it goes down the ramp. Inspect the figure below. This short lab (35-45 min) has students collect data on a golf ball rolling across a surface and then data on it hitting a variety of rolling masses. Conservation of Mechanical Energy – Procedure – Alternate Lab Objective In this experiment, you will roll a ball down a ramp and off the table, measuring horizontal and vertical distances associated with the motion in order to determine the speed of the ball at the time it leaves the table. This was because the position over time was increasing substantially. In this experiment, we are required to break the coarse salt down using a ball mill and then by using a sieve, the particle size distribution is known. Ball bearings of various sizes were inserted into the ‘mill’. Chelle's Corner. Draw blueprint. We measured the … Procedures: 1. Experiment 2 – Free Fall and Projectile Motion Objectives Learn how to solve projectile motion problems. ... energy v=velocity In the experiment the ball bearing will begin with potential energy. acceleration in an experiment by rolling a ball down an incline plane. c) What do you observe? Part 1: Pre-Lab Lab Setup (All questions in this section are based on the above experimental question.) A ball will roll down a ramp leaving the end of the ramp and becoming a projectile with a horizontal initial velocity. A ball held in the air, for example, has gravitational potential energy. If released, as the ball moves faster and faster toward the ground, the force of gravity will transfer the potential energy to kinetic energy. Now, using the stopwatch, measure the time it takes for the marble to roll 70 cm down the ramp. However, the ball was moving in a straight line on a flat plate, also decelerating due to friction. The bronze ball would roll down the groove, and he could track its motion due to gravity. Steel balls (of two different sizes) Weighing boat. You will be rolling these objects down a ramp into orange solo cups. 3. Wait about a second, then briefly push the cart up the ramp, letting it roll freely up nearly to the top, and then back down.
