Germanium silica known as GeSbTe is also used for other optical applications like rewritable DVD material. But, today most of semiconductor electronics use high purity silicon as the major material to produce transistors, diodes and other electronic devices. The two most important compounds of germanium are the dioxide (GeO2) and the tetrachloride (GeCl4). Germanium can remove the heat which can possibly make the fibers fragile. Previously, the fist development of semiconductor electronics utilized germanium as the major material. Our editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. Some musicians still use geranium transistors in effect pedals to produce the unique tone called fuzz tone. Argenium is the example of this silver alloy containing about 1.2% germanium element. -GeO2 used as an alloying agent and as a phosphor in fluorescent lamps. Germanium Oxide, Germanium Dioxide or Germania is a highly insoluble thermally stable Germanium source suitable for glass, optic and ceramic applications. Germanium is also a semiconductor element which means that this element has mixed properties of conductor (able to transmit electricity) and insulator (unable to transmit electricity). Germanium is also still in use for certain transistor applications like special music effects. Germanium Dioxide: Germanium dioxide (GeO 2) is a pre-cursor to the metallic form of germanium.A white powder, germanium dioxide is used directly as a catalyst in the production of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic or converted to germane gas (GeH 4) for the semiconductor industry.While germanium dioxide is itself produced from germanium … Another common use of germanium in optical application is as lenses for wide angle camera. Germanates, formed by heating the dioxide with basic oxides, include zinc germanate (Zn2GeO4), used as a phosphor (a substance that emits light when energized by radiation). Germanium is one of the very first and popular semiconductor material. Previously, some researches showed that spin transport and donor electron spins in germanium element indicated the long coherence times condition in the room temperature. The most abundant isotope is 74Ge with 35.9% abundance from overall germanium occurrence in nature. The uses of germanium in everyday life can be seen in various industries mainly in the optical applications and semiconductor electronics industries. Germanium has the melting point of 1211.40 K (938.25°C) and boiling point of 3106 K (2833°C). For use in electronic devices, germanium ingots or billets require further purification, which usually is effected by the technique of zone refining. Encyclopaedia Britannica's editors oversee subject areas in which they have extensive knowledge, whether from years of experience gained by working on that content or via study for an advanced degree.... 118 Names and Symbols of the Periodic Table Quiz. metal, wooden and plastic construction and building materials) and indoor use in long-life materials with low release rate (e.g. In this quiz you’ll be shown all 118 chemical symbols, and you’ll need to choose the name of the chemical element that each one represents. Nine radioactive isotopes have been reported. Both zinc-process concentrates and ash and flue dusts from coal-burning installations provide commercial sources of germanium.
