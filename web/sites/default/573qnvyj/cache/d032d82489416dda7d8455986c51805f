Skeletal muscle is one of three major muscle types, the others being cardiac muscle and smooth muscle.It is a form of striated muscle tissue which is under the voluntary control of the somatic nervous system. Muscle cells, or myocytes, contain myofibrils comprised of actin and myosin myofilaments which slide past each other producing tension that changes the shape of the myocyte. Movement, the intricate cooperation of muscle and nerve fibres, is the means by which an organism interacts with its environment.The innervation of muscle cells, or fibres, permits an animal to carry out the normal activities of life. These sarcomeres are responsible for muscle contractions. Muscle cells have mitochondria; most other cells do not. There are two sizes of filaments, thick and thin. Which connective tissue surrounds each skeletal muscle fiber? The medical examiner's office is called the following morning and describes the man's body as being in rigor mortis. A muscle fiber is composed of many myofibrils, which contain sarcomeres with light and dark regions that give the cell its striated appearance. A section of the lip that shows transverse sections of skeletal muscle is examined by a group of first-year medical students (shown in the image). Muscle fiber growth is accomplished by means of a population of myogenic cells, called satellite cells, which take up positions between the muscle fiber and the basal lamina in which each muscle fiber encases itself (see Figure 2). Factors, such as hormones and stress (and artificial anabolic steroids), acting on the muscle can increase the production of sarcomeres and myofibrils within the muscle fibers, a … They attach to the sarcolemma at their ends, so that as myofibrils shorten, the entire muscle cell contracts (Figure 19.34).
