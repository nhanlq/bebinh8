CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS: California Privacy Policy | California Collection Notice | Do Not Sell My Info. Ye… At 1 p.m., the state belatedly finished a "fire complexity analysis," a critical report that should've been completed immediately after the state's initial attack failed the previous afternoon, Orozco says. $1 for 3 months. But that didn't happen, either. They were making split-second decisions deploying aircraft, evacuating Yarnell, and calling off firefighters and equipment as the firestorm rapidly intensified. They say the report seeks to innoculate wildfire managers overseeing Yarnell Hill operations from potential liability from lawsuits and possible criminal charges. Support Us We've got to get them out of here.”The Helms never saw the Granite Mountain Hotshots on the day they died and never knew the crew was working nearby. The investigation report doesn't address why the state didn't ask Prescott National Forest officials or other federal agencies with substantial firefighter resources for immediate assistance to put out the fire. Accueil | Tag archives : granite mountain hotshots. "The more people you have involved in a decision like that, the better chance you are going to come up with a better decision," Mangan says. ", The investigation report states that, soon after, Marsh announced on the radio, "We're going down our escape route to our safety zone. difference and usually to refer to all hand crews a s they see saddling up to hump up a mountain as "hotshot crews" in their reporting. Hotshots also tend to be young—the average age of the Granite Mountain crew is 27, a number skewed by Marsh, who's 43—and few of them make a long career out of it. Ten minutes later, a Prescott wildfire dispatcher contacted the Arizona Dispatch Center and asked whether the state was "sending any air resources to Yarnell.". The movie is a stirring dramatization, directed by Joseph Kosinski, based on a nonfiction account in GQ by Sean Flynn (and co-produced by Condé Nast Entertainment), of the real-life activities of the Granite Mountain Hotshots, heroic fighters of wildfires in Arizona. The inherent contradictions in a report that assigns no blame for the deaths of so many young men reveal what murky standards wild-land firefighters must work under. "They basically told us they were working on it," Congress Fire Chief Virgil Suitor says of state Forestry Division representatives. Shumate also told state dispatch that he was "at [his Prescott] office until further notice.". Mangan, who had hoped before the report was released that it would "let the chips fall where they may," says the Yarnell Hill investigation fails to deliver clear lessons that could be used to prevent future fatal accidents. Granite Mountain, a startup outfit hosted by a small town in Arizona that most other hotshots had never heard of, wasn’t exactly well received. The warning was relayed to the Granite Mountain crew. The option of staying on the mountain all night wasn't appealing, nor was following the long trail down to Yarnell that the two hikers had taken safely a few hours earlier. When the investigation team, headed by Florida State Forester Jim Karels, released its report to the public three weeks ago, the 116-page document's astonishing conclusion was that everybody involved in the Yarnell Hill Fire did everything right -- despite the incineration of the 19 hotshots by flames so hellish that granite boulders fractured. It's unclear how Shumate came to his assessment on Friday evening. • The investigation report didn't thoroughly examine the mental and physical condition of the Granite Mountain crew on the day it was dispatched to Yarnell -- its scheduled day off and the 28th day it had worked in June. Weather forecasters issued a warning about the approaching storm to fire managers at 3:26 p.m. This is in memory of him and all the hotshots killed. Granite Mountain also didn't predict the fire's eventual path. The second air-attack plane operated only until noon, when it developed an oil leak and was taken out of service. The state's window of opportunity to put out the Yarnell Hill Fire was closing rapidly. That Granite Mountain parked its vehicles on ground that later burned and the operations chief's admission that the fire "outperformed our expectations" show that Arizona' wildfire managers failed to anticipate the Yarnell fire's potential intensity and direction during a time of year when monsoon storms are frequent, critics believe. But with local journalism's existence under siege and advertising revenue setbacks having a larger impact, it is important now more than ever for us to rally support behind funding our local journalism. The recalled air-attack plane, meanwhile, still was more than 30 minutes out -- which meant that a detailed aerial assessment of the blaze couldn't yet be made and that the single-engine air tankers, standing by in Wickenburg, couldn't yet be told where to drop retardant. Nor does the report provide any details of the crew's workload the previous month, mention that June 30 was the crew's scheduled day off, and that the crew had worked 28 days in June. . The plane, however, had flown out of the area and wasn't available for another 40 minutes. "No, absolutely not," he said. The fire officer on the plane asked an operations chief whether radio traffic should be suspended to determine what was happening. At 5:38 p.m., he alerted Arizona dispatch that the fire now posed a threat to Yarnell and Peeples Valley in the next 24 to 48 hours. But the Wickenburg retardant-reloading base wasn't operational until after 3 p.m. Along with the other 18 hotshots… The state's scramble for personnel required it to make a crucial decision that directly affected the Granite Mountain Hotshots. In addition to the air-attack plane, Shumate ordered two single-engine air tankers at 8:33 a.m., but they were hundreds of miles away. Some say, it is like a little Grand Canyon. ), The state Forestry Division's dispatch log, however, shows that an Arizona dispatcher requested at 6:21 p.m. on June 29 that the SWCC send two hotshot crews to Yarnell by 6 a.m. the next day. The drought-stricken desert scrub, combined with the thunderstorm's powerful winds, generated a wall of flame that surged across relatively flat ground at about 12 miles per hour -- extraordinarily fast for a fire. On one hand, the National Interagency Fire Center website instructs them always to obey the 10 "Standard Fire Orders" and 18 "Watch Out" situations developed to protect firefighters in the field. The tragedy all but wiped out the 20-member Granite Mountain Hotshots, a unit based at Prescott, authorities said Monday as the last of the bodies were retrieved from the mountain … Instead, it focuses almost exclusively on dead firefighters whose actions and decisions cannot be explained. The question of why the men were there haunts Andersen. The report concludes that, because of a lack of communication between the Granite Mountain crew and fire managers and other firefighters in the 30 minutes leading up to the hotshots' entrapment, it's impossible to determine why the crew decided to leave the safe burned-over area and descend into the chaparral-choked box canyon -- an action that violated numerous firefighting safety protocols. "Right after they went by, the leaves started to blow. Shumate's first mistake was failing to place an order for an air-attack-command plane until 8:33 a.m. A little later, the aircraft broke down before takeoff. The Granite Mountain Inter-agency Hotshots were committed to 73 days of fire assignments, completing 356 assessments, 56 homes were treated, 148 additional homes were assessed for treatment, 137 chip jobs were completed, 101 hazardous trees felled, and 222 … As with New Times' other request of her, Forestry Division public information officer Dennett didn't respond to e-mails and voicemails requesting information on when Cole and two other safety officers, also requested on the afternoon of June 30, arrived and assumed duties in Yarnell. . One of the planes, holding 450 gallons of retardant, took off from the Marana Regional Airport at 9:24 a.m. and another, with 750 gallons of retardant, departed from Wilcox at 9:43 a.m. Former Yarnell Fire Chief Peter Andersen sat under a tree in his front yard having his morning coffee on Sunday, June 30, when the Granite Mountain Hotshots drove past his Glen Ilah home. The report, he says, didn't analyze adequately the state's management of a complex series of events leading to the fatal incident to determine factors that contributed to it.     Staff, About 4 p.m., an aircraft crew member got worried after hearing a comment on the plane's radio referencing a crew and a safety zone. "I could see [the fire] coming over the ridge . There were the El Granite Mountain Captain Jesse Steed assumed immediate command of the crew. The state then requested a federally managed full Type 2 team. For reasons that remain unknown, the Granite Mountain Hotshots left their safe spot in a burned-over area on a ridge sometime after 4 p.m. and dropped down the side of the mountain.         About Us, . The plane was repaired a couple of hours later, but Shumate released it from the Yarnell Hill Fire. \"Ma'am,\" he said. The fire got the upper hand at 5:18 p.m. when it jumped a two-track road that served as a firebreak on the eastern flank and quickly spread over two acres. rolls of fire, fire jumping up 40, 50 feet in the air," Gilligan recalls. A helicopter with a water bucket and handful of firefighters flown to the ridge top could've knocked down the then-half-acre Yarnell Hill Fire on Friday evening, experienced wild-land firefighters and former hotshot crew leaders say. The intensity and speed of the wildfire as it stormed toward Yarnell stunned the state's management team: "The fire way-outperformed our expectations and surpassed any thoughts we had about our trigger points," one of the two operations chiefs told investigators. The air-attack plane then left the area because the pilot was approaching the limit of hours he could fly legally in one day. Shumate knew this meant trouble. The planes each made two drops of retardant near the fire before noon and then landed in Prescott to refuel and for the crew to have lunch. Instead, it focuses on a dispatch from the air-attack plane's fire officer, who flew over the fire and reported that it was in a boulder field with no vehicular access and showing little smoke. But they didn’t. • Once the initial attack failed, the state dispatched a skeleton management team to direct firefighting operations, but the team didn't have sufficient resources to adequately fight the blaze. Former hotshot supervisors suggest that one reason the SWCC initially stated that only Blue Ridge was available was because Granite Mountain would be working its 13th consecutive day on its scheduled day off. "No way are we were going to hang around there. . Even, "The voice of what actually happened, we’ll never know, Willis says. Not only was the state slow to respond, it sent in an ill-equipped, six-man crew from Lewis State Prison that wasn't trained to handle initial attacks on wildfires (such crews generally are used for mop-up operations), wildfire experts say. The operations chief stated that Granite Mountain was the crew mentioned and that "they're in a good place. "It [would be] negligent not to physically see the fire and make a call on it," Orozco says. Former Yarnell Fire Chief Andersen is convinced that the fire could've been extinguished the evening it started if the Yarnell Hill Fire Department and the state had quickly responded. It would constitute a serious management failure if Shumate wasn't on scene to personally assess the fire on the night it started and then made decisions on how and when to deploy resources, says wildfire expert Paul Orozco. . With each passing minute, the fire gained ground, as wildfires tend to do in the late afternoon. According to the investigation report and dispatch logs, Shumate, after talking to the air-attack plane, determined it was "less than a half-acre in size, 80 percent out, active only in one corner with low spread potential and no structures or people at risk. So obviously the Granite Mountain Hotshots left where they were because they thought that they could make it in a timely fashion to the Boulder Springs Ranch without getting killed. They are braver than they ought to be.". After Shumate lost control of the fire, his Forestry Division bosses called in more than a dozen fire-management specialists as part of a "Type 2 Short" team to take over fire operations the next day. Cole lives in Chino Valley and faced at least an hourlong drive to reach the incident command center in Peeples Valley. Shumate's problems continued to mount. The exchange between the air-attack officer and Marsh was another opportunity where a safety officer or an independent division supervisor could've played a key role by clarifying Marsh's intentions and advising him to keep the crew in the charred zone. The investigation report, however, doesn't elaborate on what Marsh's plan was. Four years ago, one of the deadliest wildfires in US history claimed the lives of 19 firefighters in Arizona. Campbell suggests that Marsh and Steed knew that the crew was tired, hungry, and low on water. 18 of the firefighters killed in the Yarnell Hill Fire were members of the elite Prescott-based the Granite Mountain Hotshots — like the Navy SEALs of firefighting. "They were behind the curve," says expert Doug Campbell. Shumate turned down the opportunity to call in the big DC-10 tanker at 5:50 p.m. The converted DC-10s are capable of carrying up to 11,400 gallons of retardant.
