But there is a whole other world of mathematics to enjoy and explore and that is the world of shapes! Here, we have only covered the basic shapes; other shapes are unique and different, like the shape of a computer mouse. In other words, a plane object that has only length and breadth is 2 dimensional. On the other hand, defining attributes such as the number of sides (parallel or non-parallel, straight or curved), vertices, edges and faces of a shape, whether the shape is open or closed, and the angle measures determine the shape of a two-dimensional or three-dimensional object. In advanced mathematics, quasi-isometry can be used as a criterion to state that two shapes are approximately the same. Instead of handing out math shape-coloring worksheets to your preschoolers and kids, play the game “show me” with them. Here’s a list of 2-D or two-dimensional shapes with their names and pictures: Here’s a list of 3-D or three-dimensional shapes with their names and pictures: The color, overall size, and orientation, called the non-defining attributes of a two-dimensional or three-dimensional shape, do not define or affect the shape in any way. Irregular shapes are asymmetrical. A face is a 2D shape that makes up one surface of a 3D shape, an edge is where two faces meet and a vertex is the point or corner of a geometric shape. Cousin Fal's shape collection. Their are several activities you can do from here, you could record the different shapes and their properties, draw them from different views or even make 3D shape angry birds using this link. In geometry, a shape can be defined as the form of an object or its outline, outer boundary or outer surface. For example, the (three-dimensional) platonic solids tessellate the 'two'-dimensional 'surface' of the sphere. 2D Shapes.
