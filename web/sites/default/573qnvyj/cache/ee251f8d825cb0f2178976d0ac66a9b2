Grounded theory (GT) is a research method concerned with the generation of theory,1 which is ‘grounded’ in data that has been systematically collected and analysed.2 It is used to uncover such things as social relationships and behaviours of groups, known as social processes.3 It was developed in California, USA by Glaser and Strauss during their study—‘Awareness of Dying’.1 It … While conducting research using grounded theory, it is important to fully understand the advantages and limitations of this research method. According to Charmaz: " Grounded theory refers to a set of systematic inductive methods for conducting qualitative research aimed toward theory development. Grounded theory is generally used in the absence of a comprehensive theory on the phenomena of interest. It is also conceptually strong, and I particularly enjoy its highly structured approach to concomitant data collection and analysis, which allows rich and deep data to evolve into a theory. The common methodology used in grounded theory is qualitative (Glaser & Strauss, 1967). K. Charmaz, in International Encyclopedia of the Social & Behavioral Sciences, 2001 Grounded theory is introduced as an inductive, comparative methodology that provides systematic guidelines for gathering, synthesizing, analyzing, and conceptualizing qualitative data for the purpose of theory construction. Advantages of Grounded Theory Personally, I find grounded theory to be charmingly simple, intuitively attractive, and conducive to creativity. The term grounded theory denotes dual referents: (a) a method consisting of flexible methodological strategies and (b) the products of this type of inquiry. To sum up, Grounded Theory is recommended to use in any research as it provides several advantages that may ease the process of having the data/findings. Grounded theory was developed in the early 1960’s by Glaser and Strauss. It provides a detailed illustration on how this method can be used to build an internationalization theory.To be  Keywords: Grounded Theory, Advantages, Constructivist Grounded Theory According to MacDonald (2001) Grounded Theory (GT) is characterized by its concrete and structured guidelines, a feature that helps novice researchers in their investigation and is a good fit for the pragmatic approach of the practice of nursing. Keywords: Grounded Theory, Advantages, There are many challenges and criticisms attached to the conduct of research, none the least of which is a notion that much of the research undertaken in professional disciplines such as nursing may not have clinical and/or practical relevance. Despite that, Grounded Theory helps researchers analyzing the data early and it encourages detailed analysis of the data. write that: In the grounded theory approach, the researcher analyses the data first to … This paper demonstrates the benefits and application of Straussian Grounded Theory method in conducting research in complex settings where parameters are poorly defined. First, it provides a systematic approach to analyzing qualitative, mostly text-based data, which is impossible using the traditional experimental approach. and Lincoln, Y.S. (2005) The SAGE Handbook of Qualitative Research 3rd ed.) Grounded theory offers many advantages, however because it is such a painstakingly precise method of study, it requires high levels of both experience and acumen on the part of the researcher. Grounded theory obviously has a number of advantages. Increasingly, researchers use the term to mean the methods of … With its theoretical orientation based in sociology, GT strives to understand and explain human behavior through inductive reasoning processes (Elliott & Lazenbatt, 2005).
