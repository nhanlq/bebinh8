Once again, if you add even more energy, you'll fall, you'll still be in the second shell but you will be into one of these orbitals that have higher energies so you could view this as the 2p orbital that is in the x-dimension. Don’t worry there is always an easier way to memorize these things. The data are adapted from references 1-3. Lv 4. Noble Gas notation, also known as core notation is a shortened version of the format for electron configurations using the noble gas to represent the completed orbitals of the atoms structure. The shorter version can still get tediously long for elements with a lot of electrons. If we're going to make this short hand and make the electron configuration for this we would make this 1s2, 2s2, 2p6, 3s2, 3p6, 4s2, 3d4 okay from now on every time you see 3d4 you're going to change it, we do not like 3d4. Once again, you have this spherical orbital, it's just a little, it's more likely to be found further out than the one, it was just in the one shell. Save. Answer Save. The electron configuration for aluminum would go from the orbital notation version: to the shorhand version: 1s 2 2s 2 2p 6 3s 2 3p 1. What is the Orbital Notation for Ti? 16 days ago by. The 7 is written first. The Aufbau principle says the first two electrons would fill the 1s orbital.
