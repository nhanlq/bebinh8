However, the salinity minima in July 1994 (11‰) significantly reduced gonad weight and GSI from winter 1994/1995, suggesting that a single storm event had a dramatic but short-term reproductive impact on the population. Scallops are sensitive to changing environmental conditions such as seagrass losses, increases in fresh water and loosening of sediments. Scallops reproduce by spawning, which is when organisms release eggs and sperm into the water. Because Florida bay scallops typically only live one year, local populations are more susceptible to periodic collapses. It takes a year for them to mature.
